Lush grass overgrows the earthen mound;<br />A thousand years may bury the bones, but not the shame.<br />The world today is rife with eyes and ears,<br />Yet how many truly possess the clarity to see?

Heaven blinds the eye to spare the heart its sorrow,<br />Yet mortals persist, insisting on the sight.<br />The dazzling affairs of the world are hard to fathom—<br />Beyond Mount Wu, how many autumns fade?

The chronicles record but a few lines of names,<br />While Mount Beimang holds countless desolate graves.<br />The lands of the old are seized by the new;<br />Such is the end of all dragon struggles and tiger fights.

Just behold: Heaven and Earth endure forever.<br />Ten thousand streams rush the ravines—vying to be first, fearing to be last.<br />Yet the whisper comes: "The myriad daos are endless, and the journey spans the ages."
