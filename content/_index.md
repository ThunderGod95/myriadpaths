The old man asked, “Do you want revenge?"

The youth replied, “I have been repeatedly humiliated by the strong and treated like trash by my master; how could I not want revenge?”

The old man patted the youth's head and sighed, “Good child, let me pass on my cultivation to you.”

The youth exclaimed in shock, “Senior! How can I accept this?”

The old man extended his hand, saying, “Give me your phone.”

The youth stared at the changes on his phone and cried out in astonishment, ”Senior! Where did this hundred years of cultivation come from?”

The old man smiled faintly, “Good child, this is your reserve power in the Heavenly Court. Withdraw it whenever you need it in an emergency, and never suffer humiliation again.”

The youth frowned, asking, “Isn't this a magic power loan? I'm afraid...”

The old man replied, "The Heavenly Court is a major platform. New users get thirty days interest-free on a hundred-year cultivation loan, with daily interest as low as half a day's cultivation—less than what you gain from a single cycle of breathing exercises.”

Zhang Yu snorted coldly and closed the advertisement.
