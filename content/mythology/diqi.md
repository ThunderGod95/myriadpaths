# Earthly Divinities (地祇 - Dìqí)

In Chinese cosmology, the divine world is essentially split into three tiers: the **Heavenly Gods** (*Tiānshén*), the **Earthly Divinities** (*Dìqí*), and **Human Ghosts** (*Rénguǐ*).

While the Heavenly Gods (like the Jade Emperor) are the supreme rulers living in celestial palaces, the Earthly Divinities are the "boots on the ground." They are the local deities who actually govern the physical landscape—the mountains, the rivers, and the soil itself.

Together with the Heavenly Gods, they make up the two halves of the divine cosmos: Heaven and Earth.

## Cultural Significance

### The Gods of the Harvest

Because ancient China was an agrarian society, people didn't just worship these spirits for tradition—they did it for survival.

Farmers couldn't always rely on the distant Heavens to notice them, so they turned to the local Earth spirits. Worshipping the *Dìqí* was the best way to ensure the soil stayed fertile, the rains came on time, and the harvest was plentiful.

### Yin and Yang

In the grand scheme of things, Heaven represents *Yang* (active, male, the sky), while Earth represents *Yin* (receptive, female, the solid ground). As the embodiment of *Yin*, Earthly Divinities are the nurturing force that supports life and gives humanity a place to stand.

## Their Role in the Novel

In this story, the line between a monster and a god is surprisingly thin. It all comes down to a transaction.

Most Earthly Divinities start out as Spirits or Monsters (*Yao/Jing*). Imagine a powerful tiger spirit ruling a mountain peak or a massive water serpent haunting a river. At first, they are wild, dangerous, and predatory.

They gain divinity through an exchange with humanity. Humans offer them incense and faith, and in return, the "monster" agrees to protect the area rather than terrorize it.

Over time, this worship changes them. They shed their wild nature and develop a "Golden Body"—the physical mark of a true god. Essentially, they are powerful terrestrial spirits that have been domesticated by human belief.
