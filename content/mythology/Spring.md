### The season is Spring. 'Spring' implies 'stirring'.

This explains the etmology of Spring. The description connects the character for Spring (春) to the movement of life awakening (蠢 - chunchun). It depicts insects wiggling out of hibernation and plants bursting through the soil. It defines the season not just as a time, but as an action of revitalization.

### Its position is in the East.

In the Five Elements theory, Spring belongs to the **Wood** element. The sun rises in the East, symbolizing birth, rising yang energy, and that start of daily and yearly cycle.

### Its color is Azure

It refers to the color of sprouting vegetation (green) and the clear spring sky (azure). It represents the vitality of nature.

### Its note is Jue; Jue signifies the qi moving and shining forth.

This is the third note of the ancient Chinese pentatonic scale (roughly corresponding to Mi or E).

The description of Spring associates this sound with the 'awakening' of qi. Just as plants break through the earth, the sound is sharp and rousing, symbolizing the energy of life bursting forth to "shine" (耀).

### Its emperor is Taihao; Hao means the great rousing and stirring of the myriad things.

**Taihao** refers to **Fuxi**, the legendary sovereign credited with teaching humanity survival skills. He is the "White Emperor" or "Great Brilliance" associated with the East.

Here, it is play on his name **Hao (皞)**, linking it to the concept of **invigorating (Rao | 扰)**. While _Rao_ usually means "disturb," in this context, it means to shake things out of their winter slumber and stimulate growth.

### Its spirit is Gou Mang; signifying the beginning of life for all things, and its essence is Azure Dragon; 'Mang' implies 'sprouting'

Gou Mang is the assisting deity or spirit of Wood/Spring. He is often depicted with a bird's body and a human face.

The text links the Mang in his name to Meng (萌), meaning "to sprout" or "bud."

The "Essence" refers to the celestial constellation. The Azure Dragon is the guardian beast of the East.
