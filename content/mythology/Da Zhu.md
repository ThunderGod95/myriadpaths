# The Great Invocator (Da Zhu)

**Source:** _The Rites of Zhou_ (Zhouli) — "Spring Offices" (Chunguan) **Role:** Senior Religious Official / Master of Liturgy

The Great Invocator (Dà Zhù | 大祝) is a high-ranking ritual official described in the Rites of Zhou. Located within the Ministry of Spring (which governed rites, music, and religion), the Great Invocator served as the primary intermediary between the Zhou royal court and the spiritual realm. Their duties were strictly defined by the need to maintain precise bureaucratic order among humans, ghosts, and gods.

## Management of Rituals (The Six Categories)

The Great Invocator was responsible for the "Six Prayers" and "Six Invocations." In historical texts, these two categories often overlapped in classification but differed in function (one for seeking blessings, one for preventing calamity).

### Six Prayers (Liù Qí | 六祈)

These were specific liturgical categories used to solicit blessings or favorable conditions:

1. **Lei (类):** Rituals addressed to **Heaven** (Shangdi) or the Supreme Deity.
2. **Zao (造):** Rituals addressed to **Ancestors** (specifically the royal lineage).
3. **Gui (禬):** Rituals to **Dispel Calamity** or ward off bad omens.
4. **Ying (禜):** Rituals addressed to **Celestial Bodies** (Sun, Moon, Stars) and terrestrial geography (Mountains, Rivers), often to regulate weather (e.g., stopping a drought).
5. **Gong (攻):** Lit. "Attack." Rituals of **Exorcism** to drive away malevolent spirits or pests.
6. **Shuo (说):** Lit. "Speech." Rituals of **Diplomacy** with spirits, often to resolve grievances or explain a ruler's actions to the divine.

### The Six Invocations vs. Six Calamities

* **Historical Text:** The *Rites of Zhou* lists "The Six Invocations" (**Liù Zhù | 六祝**), which mirror the categories above (Lei, Zao, Gui, etc.).
* **Textual Note:** The novel uses the term "Six Calamites/Misfortunes" (**Liù Huò | 六祸**). This is a narrative variation. Historically, the "Six Invocations" included rites to *prevent* misfortune (calamities); the Great Invocator mastered the "language of calamity" to avert it.

## Liturgical Duties

### Composing the Six Odes (Zuò Liù Cí | 作六辞)

The Great Invocator composed and recited the formal speeches used during sacrifices. These were not improvised prayers but highly technical legalistic documents presented to the gods. They included:

* **Conducting Speeches:** For directing the flow of the ritual.
* **Commanding Speeches:** For ordering spirits or lesser officials.
* **Repentant Speeches:** For atonement.

### Discerning the Six Titles (Biàn Liù Hào | 辨六号)

The Invocator had to correctly identify and address the entity being worshipped to ensure the ritual reached the right target.

1. **Shen (神):** Heavenly Gods.
2. **Gui (鬼):** Human Ghosts / Ancestral Spirits.
3. **Di (示):** Earthly Spirits (associated with land/mountains).
*(The classification further distinguished between spirits of nature, lineage, and celestial phenomena.)*

## Ritual Execution

### Discerning the Nine Sacrifices (Biàn Jiǔ Jì | 辨九祭)

The Invocator determined the appropriate "food" for each spirit. The "Nine Sacrifices" refers to the hierarchy of offerings, ensuring no god received less than their rank, and no ghost received more.

* **Great Sacrifices (Da Si):** Jade, Silk, and whole animals (Ox). Reserved for Heaven and Earth.
* **Secondary Sacrifices (Ci Si):** Animals and cloth. Reserved for Sun, Moon, and Mountains.
* **Minor Sacrifices (Xiao Si):** Animals or foodstuffs. Reserved for lesser spirits (Wind, Rain).

### Discerning the Nine Obeisances (Biàn Jiǔ Bài | 辨九拜)

The Invocator enforced the "Nine Etiquettes" of bowing, which defined the status between the worshipper and the worshipped.

1. **Jishou (稽首):** The "Full Kowtow." Touching the forehead to the ground and holding it there. (For Heaven/King).
2. **Dunshou (顿首):** The "Knock." Touching the forehead to the ground and rising immediately. (For Equals/Superiors).
3. **Kongshou (空首):** The "Empty Head." Bowing the head to the hands without touching the ground.
4. **Zhenbai (振拜):** A vibrating/active bow (often in mourning).
5. **Jibai (吉拜):** The "Auspectious Bow" (standard ceremonial bow).
6. **Xiongbai (凶拜):** The "Inauspicious Bow" (used during funerals; often performed once instead of twice).
7. **Qibai (奇拜):** A "Single" bow (used in specific military or emergency contexts).
8. **Baobai (褒拜):** A "Return" bow (answering a salute).
9. **Subai (肃拜):** The "Solemn" bow (a slight inclination of the head, often used by women or armored officers).

### Wielding Fire and Water (Zhí Huǒ Shuǐ | 执火水)

* **Function:** Purification.
* **Water:** Used to cleanse the sacrificial vessels and the altar space (lustration).
* **Fire:** Used to cleanse the air and, crucially, to transmit the offering (via smoke) to the celestial realm.
* **Symbolism:** The Great Invocator stood at the intersection of Yin (Water) and Yang (Fire) to open the channel to the divine.
