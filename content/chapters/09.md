# Chapter 9: The Ranks

Lu Shan had gathered his manpower here, leading over forty men from the Strong Force Gang as they set out hastily under the cover of night.

A gang operation of this scale was something rarely seen even once in four or five years, and for it to be initiated by a gang of boat trackers—the lowest of the low—was truly exceptionally rare.

Yet, these forty-odd men seemed to faintly exude the air of a military unit.

The group kept their mouths shut, squeezing together as they hid in the small alleys, avoiding the main roads and treading carefully as they moved outward.

There was almost no sound. Amongst the forty-odd men, there were only occasional gasps for breath or the noise of someone carelessly kicking an object.

They were trackers after all, not true soldiers, so their discipline was still far off the mark.

However, the discipline of the Strong Force Gang was much better than that of the Wave-Rowing Gang or the Water Horse Gang. One could tell at a glance that effort had been put into it.

The Strong Force Gang was taking a detour through the alleys.

The banks of the Li River were dotted with small docks; though small in scale, they were numerous, handling a massive volume of cargo ships and travelers. It was a place where fish mingled with dragons—a chaotic mix of gathered gangs, teeming with trackers, sailors, coolies, and travelers.

In the layout surrounding the Li River, the side paths and alleys were hidden behind buildings, far from the main streets, ensuring that trash and beggars would not inconvenience the merchants—after all, merchants were the lifeblood here.

Thus, due to financial reasons, the houses here were mostly low and square. Some had sloped roofs, and since stone was expensive and hard to obtain in large quantities, most buildings near the docks were constructed of wooden planks, with only a few made of stone, while more exquisite residences simply did not appear here at all.

The streets and lanes beside the docks were crowded and filthy, with garbage littering the road surface. These small paths combined to form a casually twisted knot, and unless one had lived here for years on end, they would certainly be unable to distinguish the routes within.

Such road conditions bred a vast amount of darkness inside, making the public security here rather poor, and consequently, it became an excellent hiding place.

Through these twisted alleys, one could arrive directly at the Wave-Rowing Gang's station without passing through the main roads.

Concealed, safe, and without alerting the government officials.

Regarding this plan to launch a surprise attack on the Wave-Rowing Gang and the Water Horse Gang, he had envisioned it more than once, and had even actually had the brothers in the gang attempt it.

All for the sake of a successful raid one day.

Lu Shan had always been an ambitious man. Like Li Qi, he was never resigned to being a tracker, and he wanted to climb up, making many efforts to that end.

So, faced with the temptation of a spell art, he accepted it without hesitation, not caring whether it was a fishhook or not.

Even if it was a fishhook, he would eat the bait first.

The Strong Force Gang moved soundlessly... no, they walked through the alleys with still a tiny bit of commotion.

Everyone remained silent, for they all knew what they were going to do tonight.

Occasionally a slight sound would drift out, but it did not affect them at all.

They continued until they had covered two-thirds of the journey, arriving at an empty clearing.

This clearing was kept by the dock laborers to pile up cargo during normal times. When massive amounts of goods couldn't be transported immediately, they were temporarily placed here, though never overnight—usually moved within a single day—so by nightfall, this place became empty.

Crowds could be gathered here; it was the place Lu Shan had arranged as a temporary assembly point for roll call.

According to his arrangement, upon reaching this spot, the trackers needed to assemble, talk a bit to boost morale, then rest for a moment before proceeding in one vigorous effort, using the darkness to pierce through the Wave-Rowing Gang's men in a single wave!

"Everyone, do you know what we are here to do today?" Lu Shan stood in the center of the clearing, speaking to the people around him.

It was pitch black all around, and he couldn't see very clearly, only making out dozens of silhouettes, so he simply spoke up.

"Kill Li Qi, because he stole our spell art!" a tracker answered.

"That's right. This time, Li Qi stole the spell art that belongs to us, so he must die," Lu Shan said.

The way of deploying troops lies in strong morale.

The so-called 'one vigorous effort' relies on the soldiers' morale being high.

Moreover, to have high morale, one must be in the right.

Being in the right means having a cause for dispatching troops and a common goal; only then can morale be strong.

So, the only thing that could currently unite the trackers of the Strong Force Gang was common interest, as well as the moral high ground of "taking back the stolen cultivation method."

With this great cause occupying the moral high ground, and driven further by common interests, the trackers' strength could be twisted into a single rope, transforming them from a disorderly mob into a combat-capable group.

"Remember what I teach you usually?" Lu Shan asked again.

"We remember!" the trackers nodded immediately.

"Good. Then tonight, use those things, and strive to catch them off guard and take them down in one stroke! The Wave-Rowing Gang just conducted the River Breaking today; they've been tired all day, and with wine and meat tonight, they've surely eaten and drunk their fill and gone to rest early. It is already deep into the night, so they must all be asleep," Lu Shan urged the Strong Force Gang trackers.

"So, be fast, be ruthless! But you cannot use weapons, only wooden sticks. We cannot let the officials catch us with leverage, and we must strive to only kill Li Qi without causing too many deaths."

"Don't blame me for not reminding you, this time we are risking our lives. If anyone drags their feet, don't call yourself a member of the Strong Force Gang in the future, or I'll break his legs!"

He warned the trackers.

Watching the trackers before him nod one by one, although he couldn't see the faces of those in the back clearly, they should all be able to hear him.

Having explained what to do and delivered a beating of words, he softened his tone,

"Kill Li Qi, and then we'll train in the spell art for a year. When that time comes, we will be the only tracker gang left in the city, and we can raise prices, eat meat every day, and every one of you can get a wife! You'll even be able to build new houses!"

"If Li Qi is allowed to live, it means the Wave-Rowing Gang will also have the spell art. If they compete with us, we won't have any good days left! You also know how much the price gets suppressed when two sides bid against each other, right? What we earn is blood and sweat money; who wants their prices suppressed?"

"Tonight, if we succeed, there will be good days ahead!"

Lu Shan said these words while looking at the trackers, carefully scanning those he could see clearly and observing their expressions.

Threaten with power, entice with profit; only then can their motivation be stimulated, and only then can men fight oblivious to death.

Finished speaking these things, he finally clenched his fist.

"Now, is everyone here? I'll count heads, don't let anyone get lost."

Finished, he went to count heads.

This sort of thing had happened before.

In the pitch-black alleys, the trackers couldn't see things at night—their night blindness was severe—and they often got lost when threading through the alleys.

The Strong Force Gang stood in a pile; counting heads was something they did often.

Boss Shan seemed to like counting heads very much, so they were used to it.

Lu Shan began to count the number of people.

But the more he counted, the more his expression became incorrect.

Counting until the last one, he took a deep breath.

"Why are there only twenty-six! Where are the other dozen people?! Did they all get lost?!" he roared in fury, jumping with rage!
