# Chapter 13: Homicide and Flight

The commotion tonight had been massive.

Twenty or thirty people had died. Even Lu Shan, the boss of the Strong Force Gang, was dead.

One had to realize that some of these boat trackers had families—wives and children.

With these able-bodied men dead, their families would certainly report it to the officials.

Therefore, he still had to deal with the messy aftermath.

He rushed back, sparing no time to rest, gave Sixth Uncle a few instructions, colluded on some alibis, and then immediately lowered his head to start writing.

As a modern person, Li Qi deeply understood the importance of cultural knowledge.

Although the characters in this world were different from his original world, they seemed to be of the Han character type—largely similar with minor differences—and he had learned about eighty to ninety percent of them over the past three years.[^1]

Writing essays was likely beyond him, and while plagiarism of poetry was fine, it was useless since no one listened to a tracker talk that much.

However, it could be put to use right now.

He picked up some rough kraft paper. This was material the boatmen, who were on good terms with the Wave-Rowing Gang, used to make oil paper, which was generally spread on boats for waterproofing.

This type of kraft paper was very sturdy, difficult to tear, and when made into oil paper, it became waterproof and fire-resistant—a very useful material.

It was precisely because of these properties that Li Qi chose the kraft paper.

Holding a piece of charcoal, he wrote rapidly on the paper.

If one looked closely, they would discover that he was writing the key points of the Ox Strength Art!

Including how to circulate energy, how to activate it, its nature, characteristics, how to get started as quickly as possible, and how to learn it—every detail, no matter how small, was written down.

After learning the Ox Strength Art through the progress bar, although he didn't know why, he knew this spell art like the back of his hand, every detail clearly imprinted in his mind.

Was this a good thing?

Perhaps it was.

At least for now, it was a good thing.

The night passed without a word.

He stayed up all night and wrote down how to learn the Ox Strength Art, filling four whole sheets of kraft paper to the brim.

He knew the principles of this spell art, but he had absolutely no idea what "principles" actually were.

For example, the principle of black powder is 2KNO3 + 3C + S ignites to K2S + N2 + 3CO2.

He clearly knew this string of characters.

But what was 2KNO3? And what was 3CO2?

He didn't understand.

He would just write it like this anyway; generally speaking, it shouldn't be wrong.

If it were wrong, he shouldn't be able to use the Ox Strength Art.

After finishing, he summoned Sixth Uncle.

"Sixth Uncle, this is that spell art. It doesn't matter if you don't understand the principles; the training method is at the back." Li Qi threw the folded kraft paper to Sixth Uncle.

Even if one didn't understand the principles, it didn't hinder cultivation. Just as not understanding the principles of black powder didn't hinder one from following the routine of "one sulfur, two nitrate, three charcoal" to make firecrackers.

"Little Li, are you really leaving?" Sixth Uncle put away the kraft paper, carefully placing it close to his body, looking at Li Qi with worry.

Three years ago, when he picked Li Qi up and brought him back, he had never imagined this young man would be so useful.

For so long, he had gotten used to listening to the other's ideas when encountering trouble. Now that he said he was leaving, it truly left Sixth Uncle somewhat at a loss.

"Don't worry, Sixth Uncle, I'm just going out to lay low. With so many people killed, it's hard for the government office to ignore it. They will definitely come to investigate, but this place is a mix of fish and dragons, so it won't be easy to make arrests."

There was one more thing he didn't say, which was—even if the government office used divination methods, they likely wouldn't be able to catch him.

He remembered very clearly that the young scholar who transmitted the spell art had said...

"Items of the Outer Dao are strange and unpredictable; methods of divination find it difficult to trace their tracks."

If items of the Outer Dao were difficult to trace, then what about himself, a person of the Outer Dao?

If divination couldn't calculate his location, then relying solely on reasoning, he felt he should be very hard to find.

Yes, not discovered, but found.

He prepared to take all the blame, then decisively run away and leave this place.

He didn't know where he was going, but he would carry the charges and run first.

Because, once they couldn't find the person within a short time, the government office very likely wouldn't establish a case. Unsolved homicide cases would affect the year-end evaluation, and the constables weren't happy about that either.

As long as a case wasn't established, it would be a cold case, and would be forgotten by people in a year or two at most.

This was dangerous because if he was caught, he was definitely done for.

But there was no choice; one couldn't kill people without taking any risks, right? He had already gambled with his life last night, so gambling one more time didn't matter.

"Next, I'll be a fugitive fearing punishment, but I will definitely come back. You can rest assured," Li Qi said to Sixth Uncle.

"Remember, bite to death that it has nothing to do with you guys; I did it all," Li Qi instructed emphatically.

"I understand... but you take care. By the way, this is the reward money from the River Breaking earlier, plus some of the gang's savings. You can use it outside. Oh, and remember to buy some good clothes; people outside judge others by their clothes the most, don't get looked down upon."

"A man away from home is as cheap as a dog. Once you leave the gang, life will definitely be hard. Endure it when you encounter trouble outside, and come back when the wind has passed." Sixth Uncle muttered, then took out a bag of copper coins and stuffed it into Li Qi's hands.

Li Qi watched Sixth Uncle rambling on, then took out a heavy bundle. It was full of copper coins, some new and some old, but there were no clothes and no dry rations.

He knew the reason for the lack of clothes; the gang really couldn't find a single new set of clothes. As for the dry rations, it was because his escape route wouldn't allow him to bring them.

"Don't worry Sixth Uncle, I will definitely come back as soon as possible." Li Qi took a breath, accepted the bundle, and tied it to his back.

Killing and leaving home, it really had the air of a Chu Kingdom knight-errant from the Spring and Autumn period[^2], even though he wasn't some knight-errant, just a broken-down tracker.

But there was no way around it; if he hadn't struck first, the one dead tonight would have been him.

Li Qi had always been a decisive person. He didn't hesitate much, simply promised Sixth Uncle he would return, and immediately set off. He didn't go through the city gate but climbed onto the bottom of a cargo ship, preparing to flow out with the current.

Although the Li River hadn't completely thawed yet, as long as trackers were willing to pull, the boat could still sail.

As for the cargo ship, that was intelligence provided by the boatmen.

Li Qi carried two clay pots on his person, the mouths covered with oilcloth. They were empty inside, but as long as Li Qi turned the mouths upside down and opened the oilcloth underwater, he could breathe the air inside.

Combined with the Wave-Shattering Force, the air in these two pots could let him last an extra two hours underwater.

The other trackers of the Wave-Rowing Gang had suppressed the price to the lowest, accepting the towing order for that cargo ship. The price was practically working for free, just to ensure they would definitely get the job.

They would drag the boat Li Qi was hiding under out of the city.

Everything was arranged. Li Qi took a deep breath until his lungs were full, then dove into the water and clung to the bottom of the cargo ship.

Hiding under the hull, he heard the brothers from the Wave-Rowing Gang outside begin to roar their chant.

"Ropes on shoulders, nine zhang three! He-hai!"

"A life of toil, to shoulders cling! He-hai!"

"Feet kick stones, hands claw sand! He-hai!"

"Don't say currents stop the boat! He-hai!"

This continued until the cargo ship left the city, leaving Li Prefecture.

His observation implies this world uses a script similar to Traditional Chinese or an older variant (like Seal Script), which shares the same structure ("Han type") but looks slightly different.
[^2]: A reference to the Renxia (wandering vigilantes/knights) of the Spring and Autumn Period (770–476 BC). In ancient Chinese history, particularly in the southern State of Chu, these figures were celebrated for valuing personal justice and loyalty above the law. They often committed violent acts to avenge wrongs and were forced to flee their homes, living as honorable outlaws.
