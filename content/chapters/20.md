# Chapter 20: What Is That?

South of the Central Plains, traveling untold thousands thousand _li_, lay the Hundred Thousand Mountains. Within these great mountains were hundreds and thousands of small kingdoms practicing Shamanic and Gu arts, revering myriads of gods. This place was called Baiyue[^1].

In Baiyue, gods were countless, and rural illicit cults were innumerable. Mountains had their mountain spirits, and waters had their water monsters. Most were local people, ghosts, demons, and spirits who possessed some spell arts. Over generations, they received incense offerings from the locals and thus became mountain and water gods.

This was a major difference from the great region of the Central Plains. In the Central Plains, every god and temple was without exception enfeoffed by the imperial court and subject to government jurisdiction, not created through worship.

"I've already fled from the Central Plains all the way here. Surely the imperial court can't command Baiyue, can it?" the delicate woman said to herself as she stood up, her expression shifting uncertainly.

But after careful consideration, her expression changed several times before she finally rose to her feet, murmuring, "These Shamans are no longer the Shamans of the old Baiyue..."

"The Tang Empire governs the world with the Human Dao, spreading its influence everywhere. Even the kingdoms of Baiyue have begun to follow the Human Dao, establishing prefectures and counties, and appointing officials. The original temples, shamans, grand diviners, diviners, halo observers, and the invocators of various tribes are no longer the absolute masters of Baiyue like before. If the Tang Empire gave an order, it would be quite normal for some to respond over here in Great Deer."

"But... the Ox Strength Art. That is the spell art of a Grand Invocator. Have even the Grand Invocators of Baiyue become running dogs of the Tang Empire? I should go take a look before drawing any conclusions." The woman paced back and forth in the temple but ultimately couldn't set her mind at ease. She stepped out of the dilapidated temple, preparing to see for herself what was happening.

There were countless cultivation methods in the world, but generally speaking, they were all passed down from various Daoist Traditions. Although one could not say they were completely distinct from one another, they all generally bore very clear characteristics. For a cultivator who had reached a certain level, a single glance was enough to tell where a certain art originated and from which lineage it had developed.

Countless cultivation methods, when traced back to the source, were inevitably linked to those major Daoist Traditions.

The Ox Strength Art was one such case. This spell art originated from the Shaman Dao of Grand Invocators of Baiyue. It was initially born from prayers for great strength and could invoke divine power to bless one's own body. It was one of the most fundamental introductory spell arts for practitioners of the Shaman Dao.

Precisely because it was basic, the application of this spell art was also extremely widespread, combining defense, body strengthening, and offense in one. It was a very practical spell art.

The Myriad Beast Strength that the Grand Invocators of Baiyue were particularly skilled in originated from this. Aside from Ox Strength, there was Tiger Strength, Elephant Strength, Eagle Strength, Hui-Serpent Strength, and hundreds of others.

Baiyue had many gods, and most of these gods were spirits and monsters formed by receiving incense offerings. Therefore, in the beginning, the Grand Invocators of Baiyue traveled throughout the Hundred Thousand Mountains, visiting several hundred accomplished great gods and using various means to finally gather the power of these numerous deities and, through prayer, form this series of Myriad Beast spell arts.

As long as one cast it, one could draw divine power from one of the Great Gods, granting the physical body various divine wonders; it was truly marvelous.

Such were the origins of the Myriad Beast art.

Because of this origin, trying to stumble upon this method through training was impossible. Without receiving the divine will inheritance of a certain Invocator, when you cast the Myriad Beast art, those Great Gods wouldn't bother paying attention to you. They only agreed to lend power because they established agreements with the Grand Invocators back then. If a random person cast it, even if all the steps were correct, it would be useless. Not only would they fail to borrow power, but they might even suffer a backlash.

The woman quietly infiltrated the black mist, but the black mist showed no resistance to her; instead, it wrapped around her tightly.

This woman cautiously observed the battle of Li Qi and the others.

Li Qi and the burly man were frantically wearing down the black mist, having already reduced its volume by nearly a third, yet the black mist could do absolutely nothing to them.

They could fight with reckless abandon, but as soon as they revealed a flaw and the black mist prepared to pursue, the merchant group and Ah Du behind them would immediately step forward, forcing back the black mist and resetting the battlefield.

Li Qi and the others could make mistakes freely without scruples. After all, as soon as they fell to a disadvantage, their teammates behind them would immediately follow up. They were extremely reliable, placing them in practically an invincible position.

The battle had only been going on for five or six minutes, and the black mist already showed signs of wanting to retreat.

The woman lurked in the black mist, watching the situation outside carefully.

After watching for a few minutes, she breathed a sigh of relief.

_It shouldn't be. If it were truly a Grand Invocator... they wouldn't just send this kind of pawn to test the waters,_ she thought to herself.

A Grand Invocator controls the Six Calamities and Six Prayers, composes the Six Odes, discerns the Six Titles, Nine Sacrifices, and Nine Obeisances. Weilding fire and water, he serves ghosts and gods through invocation. They are extremely skilled in divination and sacrifice[^2]. Most have ghosts and spirits accompanying them, and possess the blessings of numerous divine powers. Their strength is extraordinary, far surpassing ordinary people. If one had truly calculated her location, they should have descended directly.

Furthermore... a Grand Invocator wouldn't go so far as to find her here. She was just a small pawn; they should be looking for the Lady...

She relaxed and prepared to leave the black mist.

But at this moment, she suddenly felt a burst of danger!

_What is happening? Wasn't that little Shaman casting the Ox Strength Art fighting this small beast? Why is he suddenly coming towards me?!_

Meanwhile, on Li Qi's side.

He had been carefully observing his surroundings.

Actually, he was mainly observing the movements of the black mist to prevent any sneak attacks.

But halfway through observing, he suddenly saw an additional progress bar appearing.

<div class="rustic-frame">

Observation: 1%.

</div>

He understood immediately. This was the main culprit arriving.

It might very well be the instigator of this cloud of black mist, or the caster.

For instance, this black mist might actually be the opponent's spell art.

In any case, intruding suddenly without making a sound, quietly hiding in the black mist—it definitely wasn't anyone good!

Thus, while feigning to continue engaging the black mist, Li Qi suddenly switched directions and roared, "Come this way!"

Hearing this, the burly man knew this fellow must have discovered something, so without much hesitation, he immediately shouted to the back, "Those behind, follow up!"

Two muscle men charged like wild boars in one direction, followed by a dozen sturdy men singing loudly while banging wood choppers together. The scene was chaotic in the extreme.

Even the black mist couldn't react in time as the crowd rushed past!

Li Qi, sharp-eyed and deft, snatched up the figure. It felt human to the touch—likely a woman or a child, given the skin was smooth rather than rough like a man’s.

Of course, some men had smooth skin too, but Li Qi preferred to believe he was holding a woman.

"I caught it!" Li Qi shouted loudly.

Although the person in his hand was struggling, he possessed six thousand eight hundred _jin_ of giant force. His hand was like an iron clamp; how could an ordinary person break free?

"Good!" The burly man also shouted, then hacked his wood chopper fiercely at the surroundings, dispersing the surging black mist.

The black mist wanted to counterattack, but the clanging sound of weapons immediately surged over, driving the black mist away directly.

The black mist was powerless. Li Qi pulled back violently, dragging a humanoid shape directly out of the black mist!
