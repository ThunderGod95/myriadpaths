# Chapter 59: Carp Stream Intent

Carp Stream Intent was a Martial Dao cultivation method that imitated the movements of a carp.

The carp was one of the sacred creatures of the Daoist tradition, revered as the absolute paramount among all fish.

Therefore, it was perfectly normal for Luofu Mountain, one of the premier Daoist grotto-heavens, to possess a cultivation method modeled after the carp.

"Those who attain the Dao can soar up into the boundless clouds above, or dive deep into the rivers and sweeping seas below. Thus, Xiao Shi accompanied a soaring phoenix to ride the empty void, while Qin Gao mounted a vermilion carp into the deepest abyss; these are the testaments to such power."

This passage simply meant that an exalted master who had attained the Dao would ride atop a brilliant red carp to traverse the deep abyss.

Practitioners within the Daoist tradition believed that ascending to immortality required riding a carp, as carps possessed immense spirituality, could commune with the divine, and were capable of traversing the 'two poles' and the 'two realms,' allowing one to ride them into the heavens without facing any hindrance from the laws of heaven and earth.[^1] 


In reality, there were indeed carp capable of such feats. Legend spoke of a great carp demon who had forcibly occupied an entire major river, proclaiming himself a deity with vast divine abilities and boundless dharma power. All it took was a single spell art for him to completely freeze a raging river that was eight hundred miles wide and an immeasurable number of miles long overnight.

However, as a mere Rank Eight Martial Dao cultivation method, Carp Stream Intent could never possibly achieve such an absurd level of power.

The core intent of this cultivation method drew from a carp swimming upstream against raging currents, heavily emphasizing aquatic stealth, boundless stamina, and a slippery nature that excelled at continuously evading the flow of water.

Furthermore, it drew upon the fabled concept of a carp leaping over the dragon gate, training the practitioner to slowly accumulate strength through endless endurance and evasion, right up until the moment they released the entirety of their body's accumulated power in a singular, explosive burst—mirroring the fish soaring over the dragon gate.

As a Martial Dao cultivation method, the single most crucial aspect was diet. Carp Stream Intent required its practitioners to consume at least a single wisp of water qi every single day, using their physical bodies to digest the water qi and thoroughly transmute it into inner qi.

There were a few methods to consume this water qi: 

The first was to eat an enormous quantity of fish, extracting the essence directly from their flesh, since fish were born in the water and naturally contained trace amounts of water qi that could easily be digested by the stomach.

This method was incredibly clumsy, yet easily the simplest approach, as one merely needed to buy fish.

The second method was to drink water—though not ordinary water. It had to be spring water drawn directly from the true source of a river, as the purest water qi naturally generated at these riverbeds, meaning that drinking from the source and refining the liquid would grant the practitioner its innate water qi.

However, this method required delving deep into wild mountain forests to seek out pure water sources, making it vastly more troublesome than the previous approach.

The third method involved consuming rare earthly treasures bursting with water qi, such as aquatic spirit beasts, aquatic demon beasts, or artifacts like a Water Spirit Pearl.

This method wasn't even worth considering. Although it promised the best results, the fastest progression, and absolutely zero physical side effects, its greatest side effect was the crippling economic burden it would inevitably bring.

Li Qi patted the meager two hundred copper coins left in his pocket.

He needed to be realistic; that amount wasn't even enough to buy a decent slab of pork, let alone a precious aquatic spirit beast.

Moreover, this wasn't just a one-time purchase—he would need to consume it every single day!

Every single day!

Martial Dao cultivation primarily demanded unbreakable perseverance, followed closely by vast resources. Broke wretches could simply go play in the mud, as they were entirely unworthy of practicing martial arts.

Fortunately, he was currently deep within the uncharted expanse of the Hundred Thousand Mountains.

The pristine water sources that were so difficult to find in the outside world were absolutely everywhere out here.

"So, since we're currently in a place so densely packed with water networks, as long as you find a fresh mountain water source every day, the necessary volume of water qi shouldn't be an issue," Shen Shuibi remarked.

"In that case, I'll go ahead and hand the complete cultivation method over to you," she said, before beginning to demonstrate the movements for Li Qi.

Martial Dao cultivation did not utilize spell arts, instead being cleanly divided into a training method—or eating method—and a fighting method. While the fighting method required gradual, painstaking refinement, the training method could be initiated immediately.

Thus, Li Qi's second path of cultivation, completely separate from the Shaman Dao's Invocator method, commenced immediately.

According to Shen Shuibi, concurrent cultivation was actually incredibly common, though one absolutely had to clearly distinguish their primary path from their secondary path and respect certain taboos. Otherwise, they could easily suffer from chaotic internal qi and a critically unbalanced personal cosmos.

Furthermore, cultivating just a single discipline was an extremely draining affair, so concurrent cultivation was generally only utilized to patch up glaring weaknesses, as extremely few people actually had the sheer vital energy required to deeply research two separate Daoist traditions.

The Dao was vast, and a single Daoist tradition was more than enough to completely exhaust a person's entire lifetime.

But for Li Qi, his cultivation base was nowhere near advanced enough to face such problems, meaning he had absolutely no need to worry about it.

Doctoral students could justifiably claim that changing majors was extremely difficult due to their hyper-specialization, making it so they couldn't understand a different field at all.

But what problem was there for an elementary school student to concurrently study language, math, and English?

Time passed quickly. Under the restorative effects of the Great Forest Wood qi, Li Qi's body made a full recovery, taking him a mere two days to completely heal.

During this period, he purposefully slowed his pace of travel.

He only traveled for half the day, continuously searching for clean water sources as he walked.

Upon finding one, he would immediately stop and soak in the water, drinking until his belly was completely round, before following the training method to practice his Carp Stream Intent.

Every punch and every kick was deliberately executed to encourage his personal cosmos to better absorb the ingested water qi, slowly digesting it—or rather, refining it into inner qi.

Perhaps thanks to the foundational remnants of his Wave-Shattering Force, Li Qi's progression with the Carp Stream Intent was unusually fast.

This realization caused him to sigh with deep emotion.

Because, according to Shen Shuibi's earlier explanation, a Rank Eight Martial Dao cultivation method that was merely used to prop up wobbly table legs back on Luofu Mountain would be more than enough to trigger bloody slaughters and vicious power struggles among various Jianghu sects in the outside world, easily serving as the grand foundation for an entire sect.

And yet, a heavily fragmented shred of this exact cultivation method had ultimately become the Wave-Shattering Force—an art capable of establishing a tracker gang's foothold, treated as a peerless treasure by two or three hundred men who relied entirely on it to make their meager livings.

If he had ever dared to lay his hands on such a treasure in the past, rival factions and Jianghu experts would have immediately swarmed him, effortlessly striking him dead before plundering it for themselves.

For an ordinary man is innocent, yet hoarding a precious treasure becomes a deadly crime.

But right now, the adorable Shen Shuibi had casually taught this exact art to him without a second thought, casually twitching her ears as if it were entirely inconsequential.

All in all, a mere half a month had passed.

Reality truly was deeply absurd.

Knowing how insanely fortunate his current situation was, Li Qi grew to cherish every passing moment even more.

He persistently cultivated both of his methods every single day, continually accumulating entirely different strains of qi.

Every day at the crack of dawn, he woke up early to offer sacrifices to the Azure Dragon of the East, securing his daily wisp of Great Forest Wood qi.

He would then draw the peachwood charm carved with the effigy of the inner door god and perform his sacrifices, thoroughly completing his daily Invocator cultivation.

Afterward, he would travel through the morning, constantly scanning his surroundings for water sources so he could cultivate his Carp Stream Intent whenever he found one.

To be brutally honest, cultivating the Carp Stream Intent was exponentially more exhausting than performing his daily sacrifices.

Performing sacrifices demanded intense mental acuity; he had to aggressively study endless etiquette, ceremonial regulations, and ritual templates, executing every step with rigid exactness while perfectly memorizing and reciting every last process, taboo, and esoteric requirement.

These elements were incredibly complex and convoluted, and even the slightest mistake would instantly ruin all of his previous efforts, potentially invoking the sheer disgust of the Heavenly God and permanently stripping him of the right to worship them ever again.

This was the true difficulty of the Shaman Dao.

But the Martial Dao was the exact opposite.

Practiced wrong? It didn't matter; just start over.

Practiced right? Don't get arrogant; you still had to do it all over again.

Regardless of the outcome, it simply meant endless repetition—starting over, starting over, starting over.

Over and over, again and again.

He had to repeat the process until the foreign qi within his body was entirely transmuted into his own inner qi, an ordeal taking no less than six hours a day. Only when Li Qi was left utterly paralyzed from exhaustion, soaking in the water without the strength to move a single muscle, could he finally consider his daily practice complete.

But this merely marked the end of the training method.

He still had to learn the fighting method.

This was the Dao of close combat, the true essence of 'martial arts.'

Traveling for half the day and training for the other half, time seamlessly slipped by, day after grueling day.

    - **Two Poles:** This typically refers to the ultimate dualities of the universe—most prominently Yin and Yang, or the extreme cosmic boundaries of Heaven and Earth.
    - **Two Realms:** This refers to the Mortal Realm and the Immortal/Divine Realm (the heavens). Ascending to immortality means crossing an otherwise impassable barrier between these two worlds.
