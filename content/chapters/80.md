# Chapter 80: Experienced and Prudent

Li Qi suddenly realized that while Shen Shuibi usually seemed a bit naive, she could hit the nail on the head at times like this.

He awkwardly ran a hand through his hair and replied, "Yeah..."

That was exactly the case.

Li Qi was reluctant to kill. Even though letting the Wang family go carried risks, and Old Madam Wang did not seem like an honest person, he still did not want to take their lives.

Ultimately, if he truly wanted to kill them, he would not have insisted on making Old Man Li retreat.

Had he simply lent Old Man Li a hand, the Wang family would have been utterly destroyed in no time.

Li Qi was not entirely averse to killing; he just felt that taking a life shouldn't be done so casually.

Wiping out an entire family over a mere suspicion or a moment of displeasure...

Hailing from another, more civilized world, he could not easily accept such a thing just yet.

If the other party were enemies, like those soldiers or the men from the Strong Force Gang, he wouldn't hesitate to kill them.

But the Wang family were not enemies. They were just pitiful people forced to rack their brains and scheme to survive.

Therefore, even though their schemes had targeted him, Li Qi did not feel angry. He only took it as a warning to himself.

From now on, he had to be smarter. He could not allow himself to be so easily deceived.

This time, he could bear the consequences and had even reaped some benefits, but the next time might not end so well.

"So, you seem to feel guilty, Li Qi. Is it because you took on risks for this? And so you feel bad for involving me?" Shen Shuibi asked.

Li Qi couldn't hold back anymore. He turned his head. "Miss Shen, are you usually just pretending?"

This was the real reason Li Qi felt embarrassed. If it were just him, taking the risk would be fine. A man takes responsibility for his own actions; if he chose to play the good guy, it was only right that he bore the consequences.

But Shen Shuibi was traveling with him now. This meant he had dragged her into shouldering the risk alongside him, which made him feel ashamed.

"Huh?" Hearing Li Qi's retort, Shen Shuibi's eyes went blank, and she let out a confused sound.

Looking at her like this, it didn't seem like she was pretending at all...

Was it because of her overly sharp perception? Or was it pure intuition?

It was a little awkward.

"Cough, cough... it's nothing. Go on," Li Qi said, changing the subject.

Shen Shuibi's attention was immediately diverted, easily led by the nose as always.

She continued, "Well, if you put it that way, I'm the biggest source of risk for you. Going by your logic, shouldn't I be the one feeling guilty?"

Without waiting for his reply, she kept talking to herself, "See? You don't even think I'm a risk..."

Before she could finish, Li Qi suddenly interrupted, "You _are_ a pretty big risk. Don't you feel guilty?"

Hearing this, Shen Shuibi swallowed the rest of her words.

She let go of Li Qi's waist, sulking as she shrank back.

The rabbit was angry.

Sitting in the front, Li Qi also stopped talking.

The main issue was... if he let Shen Shuibi keep talking, he would feel incredibly awkward.

He shouldn't have said such things. There was no need to get so intimate. Now that they had Old Ma, a journey of ten thousand miles would only take about ten days. They would find Lady Luofu soon and part ways, so why complicate things?

For his next step, Li Qi planned to make a trip back to Li Prefecture City.

According to Shen Shuibi's route, returning to Li Prefecture City wasn't necessary. However, Li Qi decided to take a detour to visit the Wave-Rowing Gang.

First, he wanted to tell the members of the Wave-Rowing Gang to stop practicing the Ox Strength Art.

Second, he wanted to teach them the Carp Stream Intent.

As for a third reason...

There was no third reason.

Li Qi shook his head, throwing away his stray thoughts, and patted Old Ma's neck. "Old Ma, speed up! We're entering the prefecture city tonight!"

Old Ma neighed and decisively sped up.

Treading on clouds and mist, swift as a gale, the dragon colt traveled through the mountains and forests. Yi County was four to five hundred li away from Li Prefecture City, but this distance took no more than half a day to cover.

Setting off at noon, they didn't just arrive by nightfall; the sun hadn't even set by the time Li Qi reached the outskirts of Li Prefecture City.

This was the difference between having a ride and walking.

And there was an even greater difference between a simple cart and the priceless dragon colt he sat upon!

Li Qi couldn't help but sigh. A journey that had taken him half a month on foot was covered by Old Ma in half a day. The disparities in life were truly...

He only sighed for a moment before patting Old Ma's flank and dismounting.

"Old Ma, same as before. You and Miss Shen wait outside while I go into the city to buy a few things. We'll rest for the night and then go find Lady Luofu. You'd better be prepared this time, we'll be traveling non-stop."

Old Ma snorted nonchalantly, as if a journey of ten thousand miles was nothing to worry about.

Shen Shuibi was no longer angry. Her temper rarely lasted more than five minutes, and she had recovered along the way. She looked up, brimming with enthusiasm.

"Can I go into the city with you?!"

"No," Li Qi shook his head.

"Why not?" The rabbit's expression clearly showed her disappointment.

"Because I'll be right back. Besides, you're too pretty. Li Prefecture City is not Yi County. If someone catches sight of you and trouble brews, I might not be able to protect you," Li Qi explained.

The rabbit found this reasoning highly flattering, so she accepted it.

Besides, Li Qi would only be gone for a few hours.

And he would bring back gifts.

Just then, Li Qi suddenly remembered something. He pulled a hairpin from his pocket.

"Here. I bought this to strike up a conversation with a peddler while asking for information earlier. I don't have any use for it, so you can have it," he said, handing it to Shen Shuibi.

Shen Shuibi paused, then accepted it with a radiant smile, politely saying, "Thank you!"

"No need to thank me. I only bought it to get information. Besides, it's just copper; it's barely worth a few coins," Li Qi shook his head, feigning indifference. "I'll head into the city first. I should be back tonight, I won't stay long."

"Mm!"

"_Neigh!_"

Shen Shuibi and Old Ma chimed in together.

Li Qi hoisted his woven basket onto his back and swaggered toward Li Prefecture City.

Watching him leave, Shen Shuibi leaned against Old Ma's head and whispered, "Old Ma... you say he usually looks so smart, so why is he acting like a child right now? Why is he always giving me a hard time? Did I make him mad? Is it because I got too close and annoyed him?"

Shen Shuibi sought Old Ma's opinion.

Old Ma merely snorted twice. Who knew what he was thinking as he chewed the grass on the ground, his eyes half-closed, offering no comment.

As an elderly dragon colt, he couldn't be bothered with such messy affairs.

Men grow shrewd with age, and horses do too.

At a time like this, saying anything would be a mistake.

It was better to just stand by and watch.

_Don't ask me, I'm just a horse._
