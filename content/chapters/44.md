# Chapter 44: The Village

Two days had passed since Li Qi had taken in the old horse.

After Li Qi gifted it a wisp of Azure Dragon divine qi, the old horse became quite exhausted. For the past two days, he had mostly just followed slowly beside Li Qi's party, looking perpetually drowsy.

Li Qi was somewhat worried that the horse might not be able to withstand the Azure Dragon divine qi, or perhaps he was simply too old and his body couldn't keep up.

*He wouldn't just die like this, would he?*

However, Shen Shuibi studied the situation and said to Li Qi, "Don't worry, he's just grinding away the baleful qi."

Then, she began to recite from memory.

She said something like: "The upper burner expels qi to warm the flesh, nourish the bones and joints, and open the pores."

And something about how "Yin and yang are arrayed; through breath they act. Their movement is orderly, their cycle has reason. In harmony with the heavens, they never cease."

She added a few more sentences: "The middle burner expels qi like dew, flowing upward to the great valleys and seeping into the minor vessels; body fluids are harmonized, transforming into red blood. When the blood is in harmony, it first fills the minor vessels to overflowing, then pours into the connecting vessels, and once they are full, into the major meridians."

In any case, Li Qi didn't understand half of it. However, he forced himself to memorize it, intending to ponder it word by word later. He also asked Shen Shuibi for the specific meaning, and in the end, he finally managed to understand.

Inside the human body, the various types of generated qi circulate throughout the body along different channels.

Among them, the qi originating from the upper burner could warm the muscles and skin of the entire body, nourish the sinews, bones, and joints, and permeate the surface tissues.

The qi from the middle burner, like rain and dew sprinkling over the earth, flowed into the spaces between the body's muscles, large and small. At the same time, it seeped into the vessels, where—combined with harmonized bodily fluids and transformed by the heart and lungs—it became blood, circulating through the body's vascular network.

When blood circulation is smooth and orderly, it first fills the smallest vessels, then flows into the connecting vessels. Once the connecting vessels are full, it flows into the meridians. In this way, the blood and qi of the Yin and Yang meridians become abundant, circulating throughout the body with each breath.

Inside the body, the movement of qi follows these laws and cycles, just like the movement of celestial bodies and constellations—cyclical and endless.

Therefore, the microcosm of the body and the macrocosm of the outside world share the same subtle wonders.

Right now, Old Ma was using his own power to control the Azure Dragon divine qi, gradually circulating it according to these laws to grind away the baleful qi within his body.

This was because when baleful qi invades the blood vessels, it causes blood stagnation. When blood flow is stagnant and blocked, the Defensive qi in that part of the body accumulates and cannot disperse.

When qi and blood cannot circulate back and forth and are forced to gather in a specific area, they form a carbuncle. These swellings and pains accumulate heat over time. The heat toxin builds up and steams the flesh, causing the muscles to rot. When muscles rot, they turn into pus. If the pus cannot be discharged, it will cause the fascia to rot, eventually spreading into the vital region between the heart and diaphragm.

Once it reaches the vitals, it will injure the bones. If the baleful qi cannot be excreted outward, it will torment the bones, cause the marrow to stagnate, and dry up the blood.

When the blood stagnates, the tendons, bones, muscles, and internal organs will not receive Nutritive qi and Defensive qi, ultimately leading to the ulceration and decay of the fleshly body, resulting in death.

Although the wounds had been cleaned previously, Old Ma's body was still filled with baleful qi. That was why he needed to beg Li Qi for a wisp of Great Forest Wood qi from within the Azure Dragon divine qi.

At that time, Shen Shuibi had added, "The books say that when this condition occurs in the thighs and shins, it is named Thigh and Shin Gangrene. Its appearance does not change much, but the abscess and pus cling to the bone. If not treated urgently, death occurs in thirty days. That is why Old Ma is so anxious."

After listening to her explanation, Li Qi realized she was saying that although the gangrene on the thigh and shin might not show obvious external changes, the pus formed by the abscess was sticking tight to the bone. If not treated quickly, he would very likely die within just thirty days.

So Old Ma was extremely anxious.

"Great Forest Wood qi corresponds to the time of spring, when wood qi ascends. It is composed of the divine qi from the Azure Dragon of the Four Symbols, the constellation of the eastern wood. At this time, all things bloom; branches and leaves are lush, forming a dense forest. It harnesses the flourishing vitality of wood to promote one's own vitality. Wood is born at Hai[^1]; branches shake in the wind, and boughs support the moon. In this way, the baleful qi can be dispelled."

Shen Shuibi spoke in sophisticated sets of theories, bluffing Li Qi until he was stunned.

Truly worthy of being a cultured rabbit.

Then, Li Qi went back and pondered it for a long time.

*Damn it, if I translate that, isn't it just stimulating the body's immune system to let the abscess recede on its own! Relying on the body's immunity to tough out the infection!*

Having figured this out, Li Qi stopped worrying.

Fighting an infection with raw immunity would definitely cause fever, physical weakness, dizziness, and the like. He should be fine in a couple of days.

So, he simply climbed a hill to look around, painstakingly found traces of a village, and then spent half a day heading toward it.

He would go to the village first, trade his spatula, farm tools, and such for supplies, and then let Old Ma recover properly.

After all, the current Old Ma couldn't walk well, and carrying people was out of the question; he could barely move himself.

Besides, Li Qi didn't have anything good to feed him. He himself could only pick wild fruits, drink spring water, and eat rice cakes, so Old Ma could only nibble on grass and eat some green leaves.

Shen Shuibi said this wouldn't do; his recovery would be slow this way.

Li Qi also felt that if this continued, Old Ma might die before he could withstand the infection. He still needed to get some bird eggs, soybeans, or something to supplement his nutrition.

This world didn't have that many chicken eggs because the chickens here could fly... and were very fierce.

Could those even be considered chickens?

Forget it, no use thinking about that.

Old Ma seemed to know his own condition. Shen Shuibi translated many times along the way that he was constantly thanking the two of them.

Li Qi couldn't really say much. After all, the other party was an eight-foot-tall dragon colt. If he hadn't fallen on hard times due to old age, given Li Qi's status as a tracker without any destiny, he probably wouldn't be qualified to ride him in this lifetime.

So, Li Qi just told him it was mutual assistance, and later transferred the wisp of Great Forest Wood qi he had just cultivated the next day over to him.

In this way, by the second day, they finally arrived at the village.

The village was very conservative, even sporting a crude wooden wall made of thick logs driven into the ground.

Being able to establish a village in the wild—Li Qi knew even thinking with his toes that these villagers were not to be trifled with. Ordinary bandits probably wouldn't dare provoke them.

A world with cultivation is truly messed up.

"Fellow villagers!" Li Qi stood outside the village, leading Old Ma. "We are passing through! Traveling merchants! Do you want to see some goods!?"

"I have salt blocks, hoes, and rake heads! I have cloth too!" Li Qi put down his back basket, displaying the farm tools and cloth inside.

A middle-aged farmer holding a manure fork asked with a powerful voice, "Other traveling merchants come in groups. How come you dare hit the road alone?!"

"They don't have a horse! I do! They run for four days, I only run for one! I'm not afraid on the road!" Li Qi shouted back. "My horse got hurt! I want to borrow this place to rest for a day and buy some food!"

His words were reasonable and well-founded, and his basket indeed contained the salt blocks and iron farm tools that rural villages needed.

Plus, he had brought a woman.

A man traveling with a woman definitely posed no threat. Besides, there was the horse.

That was a horse. If a merchant had a horse, he probably wouldn't be interested in the meager things their village had to offer.

Simple, rustic wisdom led them to a judgment, so they opened the stockade gate. "Then come in!"

[^1]: "Hai" (亥) is one of the twelve Earthly Branches (the characters used for the Chinese Zodiac).

    It is associated with Water (specifically Yang Water).

    It corresponds to early winter (roughly November).

    In Daoist theory and Bazi (Four Pillars of Destiny), every element (Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water) goes through a life cycle: Birth, Bathing, Adolescence, Peak, Decline, Sickness, Death, Burial, etc.

    According to the Generating Cycle of the Five Elements, Water feeds Wood.

    Since "Hai" is a Water branch, it is considered the energetic "womb" or "birthplace" where the Wood element begins its life cycle.

    When Shen Shuibi says "Wood is born at Hai," she is explaining the specific potency of the Great Forest Wood qi.

    She isn't talking about dry lumber or dead wood. She is talking about the very inception of life.

    Even though Hai represents winter (surface cold), deep inside the water/earth, the "seed" of Wood is germinating. It represents the purest, most fundamental spark of growth.
