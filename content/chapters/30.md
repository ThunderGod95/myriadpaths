# Chapter 30: Beast Power

"Please enlighten this lowly one, Young Master!" Li Qi immediately stood up and bowed with clasped hands.

_It doesn't matter if I can't become a disciple. In my current situation, I have to cling to this powerful backer, even if I can only grab a single hair on his leg. I can't let this go._ Thinking this, Li Qi made a decisive choice.

Young Master Zhu, in turn, scrutinized Li Qi.

Furthermore, there was one more point: as a person of the Outer Dao, Li Qi could be confirmed to have a clean background, making it impossible for him to be a chess piece laid out in advance by some major figure.

There were not many people of the Outer Dao, but there were not few either; however, all of them could be confirmed as clean. There would not be a situation where some mighty figure had placed a pawn a thousand years in advance, calculating the karma just to make a move against you at this precise moment.

Since the Grand Rite indicated that a person of the Outer Dao could bring great fortune, it was only natural for him to make some investments.

This was the reason Young Master Zhu appeared here.

Thus, he continued, saying, "The spell art you cultivate is called the Ox Strength Art. You likely do not know the foundation of this thing, but I can explain it to you."

"The Ox Strength Art was born out of the Myriad Beasts Art, an accord reached between the Grand Invocators of Shaman God Mountain and the various Earthly Divinities."

"The cultivation paths of Shaman God Mountain are divided into three branches: Human Ghost, Earthly Divinity, and Heavenly God. Among them, the Human Ghost is the strongest, while the Heavenly God and Earthly Divinity have no distinction in superiority or inferiority."

"Leaving the other two paths aside for the moment, let us speak of the Earthly Divinity path you are currently involved with."

"The so-called Earthly Divinities are the gods of the myriad things. Mountains and rivers have Mountain Gods, water veins have Water Gods, farmlands have Agricultural Gods, and all the various local land deities and the five household gods—such as door gods and kitchen gods—all fall under the category of Earthly Divinities."[^1]

"These Earthly Divinities are mostly transformed from spirits and monsters. A Mountain God is likely a mountain spirit with profound cultivation from that mountain; a Water God is likely the strongest water monster in that stretch of water. Because they possess divine abilities and are worshipped by local residents, receiving the benefits of incense and forming karma, they take root there, nourishing their golden bodies and attaining godhood."

"Therefore, Earthly Divinities are mostly birds and beasts, and birds and beasts often possess strange abilities far surpassing ordinary humans."

"My Shaman God Mountain's Grand Invocators walked the earth, seeking Earthly Divinities and befriending myriad beasts to forge pacts with them. These entities offered up their own primordial essence, and the Shaman God Mountain Grand Invocator used the Grand Rite of Heaven and Earth as a guide to construct a Myriad Beasts Diagram. Within the Myriad Beasts Diagram, there are fourteen thousand six hundred and thirty-two spell arts. Each spell art corresponds to a mountain or water Earthly Divinity."

"Cultivating the Myriad Beasts Art uses this object as a guide. Even if separated by a thousand leagues, one can still receive the help of the corresponding Earthly Divinity, be granted its boon, and possess one of its unique abilities."

"The Ox Strength Art you cultivate is derived from the Earthly Divinity worshipped by the local villagers of Lizhou[^2] and the barbarian tribes. Its body is a white ox, and its name is Qiong. It has four eyes; its horns are curved and point inward, long and without branches, indicating a straightforward nature. beneath its eyes, there are two more eyes, which close during the day and open at night to illuminate things. Its hide is thick, allowing it to enter thorn bushes without injury; its strength is infinite, capable of carrying two mountains on its shoulders as it walks; and its body is massive, standing ninety zhang tall."

"Every time you use the Ox Strength Art, you borrow the power of the Qiong Ox through the Myriad Beasts Diagram. Thus, your body can suddenly expand by a foot, your qi and blood become abundant, carrying the strength of an ox, and your skin becomes tough, impervious to swords and spears." Young Master Zhu dropped a cascade of information.

"This is a spell art that belongs exclusively to my Shaman God Mountain Invocator lineage. Only my Shaman God Mountain Invocators can cultivate it. Moreover, this art is miraculous and has no side effects." Young Master Zhu clapped his hands and said with a beaming smile.

"There is just one point: all of this is established on the premise that you are an Invocator."

"Not being an Invocator, yet mastering the Ox Strength Art under my divine will inheritance, means that when you utilize it, you do not have the corresponding power to act as a catalyst."

"However, there is one thing in the human body that can serve as a catalyst for all spell arts, and that is Qi, one of the Pre-Heaven Three Treasures."

"The Qi is formless and immaterial. As the foundation for nourishing both Essence and Spirit, its existence is very marvelous and can serve as a substitute for almost anything. Without the proper cultivation method, you have been forcibly activating the Ox Strength Art by consuming your body's innate Qi."

"Put this way, do you understand now? Why have you been weary recently? Why have you been weak? In reality, if you continue like this, your Qi will be unable to support your Essence and Spirit. At that time, you will become increasingly weak until you finally breathe your last." Young Master Zhu said indifferently.

Hearing all this, Li Qi immediately understood.

No wonder he had been experiencing those symptoms. As he suspected... it was all related to the Ox Strength Art.

_In other words, if I hadn't passed his test, or if I had run away... I would have died from this very spell art before long._

This Young Master Zhu calculated perfectly.

However... if it was related to the Ox Strength Art...

"Young Master has been honest with this lowly one! This lowly one also dares not conceal anything. Young Master, I have something to report. Previously, I did not know the foundation of this spell art and passed the training method to everyone in my gang. Looking at it now, I fear their lives are in danger. I beg for Young Master's pity to give me some time to return and warn them not to practice it! Lest they die an unnatural death!" Li Qi said immediately!

He still had feelings for the people of the Wave-Rowing Gang, so the moment he understood that the Ox Strength Art was a lethal thing without the corresponding cultivation method, he immediately pleaded with Young Master Zhu.

He did not wish to return after a year or six months only to encounter the corpses of the Wave-Rowing Gang members.

Seeing Li Qi's reaction, Young Master Zhu was quite satisfied. The young man was clever, but not cold-blooded; he was still a man of sentiment, which aligned well with the young master's own principles.

After all, the Shaman Dao required a clear and pure heart, and Young Master Zhu himself was indeed a person of good character. If Li Qi had no regard for his old friends, he would still have pushed him out as a chess piece, but he would not have cared too much about him.

There was a difference between a chess piece and an apprentice.

So he replied, "Of course you may. As long as you do not delay the journey to find Lady Luofu, it does not matter what you want to do. But you must remember this: to cultivate the methods of Shaman God Mountain without permission will, at best, lead to failure, and at worst, lead to death."

"Oh, no, not just Shaman God Mountain—the entire world is like this. The more profound the method, the truer this holds. You must remember it well," Young Master Zhu said to Li Qi, his frivolous expression replaced by a serious one.

"Next, I shall transmit the method to you. Cultivate according to it, and you will have entered the gates of my Shaman God Mountain and found your place. Let me confirm one last time: accepting this means accepting the mission. From this day forward, you will be an Earthly Divinity Invocator of Shaman God Mountain."

Li Qi naturally would not refuse; he immediately nodded his head like a chicken pecking at rice.

Young Master Zhu said no more and lightly tapped a finger against Li Qi's forehead.

The familiar divine will inheritance.

Li Qi felt something extra in his brain.

But... it was not like the memory-like things from before, but rather... books?

A book had appeared in his brain. If he did not look at it, he knew nothing, but he could flip through it at will? Moreover, there was no feeling of his head being hit by a stick; instead, it was very refreshing, without any burden, and it even drove away his sleepiness.

This... seemed different from the previous divine will inheritance.
