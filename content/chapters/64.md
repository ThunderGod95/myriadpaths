# Chapter 64: Attention

_A girl?_

Li Qi didn't react immediately.

However, he pondered for half a second and realized she was referring to the blind old woman.

Uh... it seemed there was nothing wrong with that, either. Although Shen Shuibi looked young, he estimated her age had to be in the triple digits. She might even be a thousand years old, so calling someone a little girl was perfectly justified.

"She is a Diviner. Is there a problem?" Li Qi asked, somewhat puzzled.

Shen Shuibi usually didn't comment much on things. For her to suddenly speak up now, there definitely had to be an underlying meaning. It was just that while Li Qi was smart, he lacked culture and had read too few books to pick up on it.

"Diviners are proficient in divination. Ancient texts say: 'The Diviner oversees the four omens of the cracked tortoise shell: the first is the square omen, the second is the merit omen, the third is the righteousness omen, and the fourth is the bow-light. In all divination matters, one observes the high, raises the fire to prepare the shell, and brings out its ink. In all divinations, one distinguishes the top, bottom, left, right, Yin and Yang of the shell, to bestow the mandate upon the tortoise and announce its portents. For sacrifices, one must first divine. If there is a sacrificial rite, one shall bear the tortoise forth, first using yarrow stalks and then the shell to determine good and ill fortune.'" Shen Shuibi immediately began to recite from memory.[^1]

"This means that Diviners possess the ability to use tortoise shells for divination, discerning good and ill fortune by identifying different omens. But Li Qi, did you see? Her home was billowing with Yin qi, a terribly baleful sign at a glance. What kind of Diviner would set up such a dwelling for themselves?"

"Furthermore, look at him buying animal bones, among which was your tortoise shell. Perhaps the rest were all a smokescreen, and he only wanted to buy the tortoise shell. But if I had to guess, he encountered an inauspicious event and is preparing to shift it onto you," Shen Shuibi said.

"Shift it onto me?" Li Qi frowned.

He had read about the art of shifting misfortune in the [Book of Invocation].

Through certain mediums and rituals, one could graft their own bad luck, ominous disasters, and similar things onto someone else.

"But he didn't seem to be performing any ritual, nor did I participate in one. If there absolutely had to be a medium and channel for shifting the misfortune, it could only be this." Li Qi took out the fragmented gold from his pocket.

"It should be this, though... I just have a feeling; I cannot guarantee it..." Shen Shuibi played with her drooping hair, speaking with her head lowered.

Li Qi himself didn't feel anything whatsoever. Moreover, although it was a bit bizarre, he felt it wouldn't go to such an extent.

But Shen Shuibi said it was possible...

Li Qi believed that her speculation wasn't necessarily reliable.

However, her feeling was definitely reliable!

Therefore, his mind immediately began to turn, and he started to deliberate.

"Regardless, they have money. In the city, the poor cannot win against the rich, but we can't just act as if nothing happened, either." Li Qi stroked his chin, thinking of a solution.

The simplest way, of course, was to spend it, but there was a specific art to how it was spent.

Li Qi was not prepared to spend it on innocent passersby. If it truly was a medium for shifting misfortune, then doing so would make him far too despicable and shameless.

In his heart, Li Qi didn't consider himself a good person, but he was absolutely not a bad person, either.

He wouldn't compromise his own life or property to insist on doing good deeds, but he wouldn't do things that harmed others to benefit himself, unless that person had a grudge against him.

Under normal circumstances, he was a decent person with morals and integrity. He didn't mind abiding by the law, nor did he mind doing good deeds.

Unless forced by absolute necessity, he wouldn't do bad deeds, either.

However, the premise for all of this was built upon the fact that upholding morals and integrity would not threaten his life.

If it were the lives of ten thousand people versus his own life, Li Qi would choose his own without hesitation.

Thus, in dealing with this potentially risky piece of gold, Li Qi wouldn't toss it to someone else just because of a slight possibility. If he could solve it himself, he would solve it himself.

If he truly couldn't solve it, then he would cross that bridge when he came to it.

"Let's go buy clothes first, and then we'll talk." Li Qi didn't say much else, first taking Shen Shuibi to buy clothes.

This time, Li Qi prepared to buy two outfits.

One for traveling, one for meeting people.

He could not possibly wear these coarse linen clothes anytime and anywhere. They were cheap, certainly, but they could not be used for grand matters; he looked more like a rustic savage.

Although, to be fair, he was indeed a pauper.

In the future, he would certainly be doing other things. He might even be like other Invocators, participating in large-scale sacrifices, holding religious activities, and liaising with all sorts of figures. He absolutely had to have a good set of clothes.

After wasting a fair bit of breath and spending a full three thousand coins, he bought both himself and Shen Shuibi very vibrant cotton clothes. They were mostly cotton, but the exterior featured silk patterns. This kind of clothing was generally only affordable for middle-class families, and it would likely be the best set of clothing in such a household.

This kind of clothing could no longer be considered shabby. Even if worn to a banquet, it would at most be considered 'not that wealthy.'

Li Qi also spent another two hundred coins to buy a set of ordinary coarse cloth garments typically worn by common townsfolk. They weren't exactly decent, but they weren't as crude as linen, either. As for his current linen clothes, after living in the mountains and going through several battles and hunts, they were already somewhat damaged. It was fine to just wear them in the wilderness; he wouldn't feel heartache over ruining them anyway.

Two hundred coins would have made his heart ache terribly to spend in the past, but now, it actually felt cheap?

Sure enough, having skills made it easy to earn money.

After carefully putting away the silk-patterned clothes and changing out of his linen garments into the coarse cloth townsfolk attire, Li Qi considered his wardrobe update complete.

The silk-patterned clothes would only be kept to wear when needed. After all, a single piece cost one thousand five hundred coins; it was too expensive.

As for Shen Shuibi, she directly changed into her silk-patterned clothes.

It couldn't be helped; she possessed an Unsullied Body, untouched by dust. The linen outfit she had been wearing had neither been changed nor washed, yet it still looked brand new!

As long as they weren't forcibly torn, her clothes would never get dirty or old, let alone suffer from wear and tear, no matter how long she wore them.

It made Li Qi sigh in admiration. The Daoist saying, "there are no years in the mountains," must require this kind of ability to hold true, right?

Otherwise, dealing with eating, drinking, bodily functions, clothing, food, housing, and transport every day, plagued by so many mundane affairs, how could there be no years in the mountains?

Only by reaching Shen Shuibi's level of an otherworldly maiden could one truly squat in the mountains for a hundred years yet still flutter with immortal qi, elegant and detached from the mortal realm.

While Li Qi was lost in thought, Shen Shuibi finished changing and stepped out.

The tailor who sold them the clothes widened his eyes.

"My heavens, this young lady... she's truly a beauty," the tailor murmured, blanking out for a moment, unable to hold back.

Her silken garments fluttered, her light skirts swirling with the wind. Her glances left behind a radiant splendor, and her breathing bore the scent of orchids.

In a brief moment, her beauty overflowed, dazzling like the newly risen morning sun shining upon the roof beams, bright as the clear moon unfurling its light. Her eyes sparkled with a piercing clarity, her bright gaze so stunning it captivated all who saw her.

She wore not a trace of makeup or powder, yet the enchanting, rippling glances between her brows and eyes could coax the spring to linger.

Having traded her coarse linen clothes and unkempt hair for these silken skirts and a neatly combed style, Shen Shuibi seemed to make the entire tailor shop a few degrees brighter just by walking out.

Li Qi slapped his forehead.

He let out a long sigh.

_Damn it._

[^1]: This passgae recited by Shen Shuibi is a nearly exact quote from the _Zhouli_ (Rite of Zhou), an ancient Chinese text that details the organizational theory, bureaucracy, and rituals of the Zhou dynasty. Specifically, it describes the official duties of the Buren (Diviner).

    * **The Four Omens (四兆):** In ancient Chinese divination by fire, diviners would heat a tortoise shell until it cracked. The "square," "merit," "righteousness," and "bow-light" refer to the distinct geometric shapes the cracks could take, each indicating a different type of fortune, mandate, or outcome.
    * **Preparing the Shell & Ink (作龟, 致其墨):** This refers to the physical preparation of the oracle bones. The diviner "raises the fire" to scorch the shell. The "ink" refers to a dark pigment that was often rubbed into the freshly made cracks so the diviner could clearly read their shape and spatial orientation (top, bottom, left, right, Yin, and Yang).
    * **Yarrow Stalks vs. Tortoise Shell (先筮而后卜):** Ancient China relied on two primary methods of state divination. Consulting yarrow stalks (shi - 筮) involved numerology and hexagrams (the system famously used in the I Ching or Book of Changes). Divining with the tortoise shell (bu - 卜) involved reading the fire-induced cracks. Traditionally, yarrow stalks were cast first for general guidance, but the tortoise shell was considered the ultimate, most authoritative decree from the heavens and was consulted last.

    I've provided the basic context, but there is more to it. Here is the original source text for reference:
    
    ```
    卜人掌开龟之四兆，一曰方兆，二曰功兆，三曰义兆，四曰弓光。凡卜事，眡高，扬火以作龟，致其墨，凡卜，辨龟之上下、左右、阴阳，以授命龟者而告相之，祭祀先卜，若有祭事，则奉龟以往，先筮而后卜，以辨吉凶。
