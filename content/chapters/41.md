# Chapter 41: The Horse

Li Qi was boiling water; he prepared to boil the rice cakes in the water.

Rice cakes were very durable for storage, but they would mold if they encountered water.

The moisture in the mountains was heavy, and the rice cakes were easily shrouded by the dampness, forming water droplets, so some mold had already appeared on them.

However, it didn't matter; scraping off the surface mold spots would make them edible again.

He was doing just that, holding a small knife to carefully scrape off the moldy parts, then cutting the rest into pieces and throwing them into the water to boil.

Rice cakes had to be eaten cooked; whether boiled in water or roasted over fire, they had to be cooked through.

Raw ones—anyone who ate them knew—would block your throat, were impossible to bite through, and were like eating tires.

The water here hadn't boiled yet; he had only just cut the rice cakes and thrown them in.

Once it boiled, he would add some coarse salt, and that would count as a meal.

Recently, his cooking skills had grown rapidly because he learned to use the progress bar to control the heat, observing the food cooking progress bar; lifting the pot immediately when it was full ensured perfectly steady heat.

Although it wasn't very useful, it added a bit of fun to the dull journey; after all, boiled rice cakes made this way tasted a little better.

While boiling water, he read the *Zhù* in his mind, reading ceaselessly.

This book was simply all-encompassing; it wasn't something that could be finished in a short while, but a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, so he wasn't anxious.

He read whenever he had time every day, reading for a damn ten hours; he would finish it eventually.

After these three days, his progress had advanced to 0.6%.

It could be considered seeing hope.

He also persisted in cultivation every day. Now, inside his body, there were already four strands of Great Forest Wood qi and three strands of inner door god Earthly Divinity divine qi. These qis wandered within him, allowing his body to receive a certain degree of strengthening every day.

Moreover, through reading, he gradually learned how to utilize these qis.

Although he was still very unskilled, Li Qi felt that the current him could beat three of the old him to death.

Being able to utilize qi was truly no ordinary strength.

Just as he was boiling rice cakes, watching the progress bar while reading the *Zhù* in his mind, he suddenly heard Shen Shuibi shouting for him.

"Li Qi! Li Qi! Come here, quick!"

Li Qi stood up immediately, feeling a bit strange.

Shen Shuibi usually wouldn't speak if he didn't initiate the conversation; why was she suddenly shouting for him today?

However, since it was rare, he rushed over immediately.

Perhaps she had found some clue.

Li Qi ran over quickly, and since it wasn't far, he arrived very soon.

"What is it, Miss Shen?" Li Qi asked.

"I... I-I, I!" She seemed to stutter, excitedly repeating herself continuously.

Li Qi didn't rush her but examined her excited expression, wondering what had happened. Did Lady Luofu come to find them herself?

"I... I found a horse! It's right ahead! I heard the sound!" Shen Shuibi said excitedly, then grabbed Li Qi's sleeve.

"A horse? Why didn't I hear it?" Li Qi touched his head.

Where would the sound of a horse come from?

"Of course you couldn't hear it!" Shen Shuibi said. Then, a pair of rabbit ears suddenly stood up on her head.

They were white, furry, stood very straight, and looked quite cute.

After showing them off, she retracted them again, shaking Li Qi's sleeve and saying happily, "We can ride a horse. With a horse, our speed will be faster!"

Hearing this, Li Qi didn't feel happy.

He certainly knew what a horse was.

But the horses of this world... were not that simple.

Why was there no animal husbandry in this world?

Very simple: because these livestock were all large tanks. Pig hide could make blades bounce off, so horses naturally wouldn't be ordinary horses either.

He had seen quite a few spirit horses; they were owned by big shots on ships. At that time, looking at their strength, he felt these horses could casually kick him to death.

Even now, he still didn't dare say he could beat these horses...

Maybe he could barely beat one?

"Miss Shen, even if there is a horse, can we catch it?" Li Qi said with a bitter smile. "That's a horse."

A horse—leaving aside whether they could beat it, they definitely couldn't outrun it.

People in this world could walk a hundred *li* a day on their legs; for a creature like a horse, traveling eight hundred *li* a day easily was probably no problem.

"No need to catch it. With me here, I just have to talk to it and ask for its help, and it will definitely be willing!" Shen Shuibi said in a happy tone.

Li Qi paused; maybe that would actually work?

This girl was also a demon.

If not for her crippling her own cultivation body, he estimated he could be slapped to death by her.

"Then, give it a try?" he said.

If they could really have a horse for transport, leaving aside speed, just the horse itself would be very intimidating; he estimated it could disperse a lot of hostility and potential threats.

As for the horse being very valuable, Li Qi directly ignored such things.

Since he couldn't sell it anyway, and it wasn't a horse he tamed himself, it was better not to do that, especially since even Shen Shuibi used the phrase "ask for its help."

"Mn! Let's try, take me there quickly!" Shen Shuibi's mood seemed very high.

Li Qi didn't say much more. He hid the basket well, placed the rice cakes and pot on the ground temporarily, stomped the fire out with one foot, and scattered a handful of dirt over it.

Then, carrying Shen Shuibi, who had lost her cultivation body, on his back, he strode out in a wild sprint!

Li Qi circulated the collected Azure Dragon divine qi—which was the Great Forest Wood qi of spring—throughout his whole body. In an instant, his speed not only increased, but he could also sprint wildly for two hours without getting tired.

Great Forest Wood qi represented vitality; it allowed injuries to heal faster, made the body more robust, and made stamina more durable.

Unfortunately, doing this would consume a strand of qi, so he usually couldn't bear to use it.

He could only save up one strand of Great Forest Wood qi a day; how could he possibly use it for traveling?

However, if he didn't use it when it was time to use it, what was the difference between having it and not having it?

This was a horse!

Li Qi carried Shen Shuibi, raiding rapidly through the mountain forest, running with all his might!

Trees and crushed stones scratched small cuts on his body, but under the effect of the Great Forest Wood qi, these small cuts healed at a slow speed; a cut would grow back together in about a minute.

Normally speaking, Li Qi would be exhausted to death after sprinting for ten minutes, but with this now, his stamina was endless, and he didn't feel tired at all!

This was the effect of the Azure Dragon divine qi; even a petty Invocator who hadn't entered the ranks could gain power they wouldn't dare imagine normally.

Li Qi wasn't just running on the mountain path; he was climbing mountains and jumping. In any case, he was using the fastest speed and the shortest distance to rush to the place where the horse existed, as heard by Shen Shuibi.

Shen Shuibi listened intently, discerning the direction.

Only, as she listened, she suddenly said, "That horse... seems to be crying? He didn't run away; instead, he's coming towards us."

"Coming towards us? Crying?" Li Qi was stunned.

Then, he suddenly realized that he also heard the horse's neighing.
