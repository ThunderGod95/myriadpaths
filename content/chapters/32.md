# Chapter 32: War

Shen Shuibi was yanked out from behind Young Master Zhu and placed directly in front of Li Qi.

"It's you!?" After she truly saw Li Qi's face clearly, she shouted out in surprise, even forgetting how she had been unwilling to come out just moments before.

Shen Shuibi's eyes reddened!

She knew it; these Baiyue Invocators were surely weaving one scheme after another!

Having met this young Invocator before, she should have thought that a Grand Invocator would immediately follow.

Great, now she had fallen right into their trap!

However... it seemed that Shaman God Mountain probably, maybe, perhaps... bore no ill will.

Otherwise, based on what they said, they could have just captured her and taken her back as a sacrificial offering for divination; there was no need to have her lead the way to find the Lady.

But...

She couldn't just trust them!

The rabbit demon's mind was filled with rage. She resolved that she absolutely could not trust these Invocators. They had plotted against her once, and they would certainly have more tricks up their sleeves!

She was the Lady's rabbit, and everything she did had to be for the Lady's sake. She could not blindly accept their one-sided story.

With these thoughts, Shen Shuibi stared at Li Qi and Young Master Zhu, her cheeks puffed with anger and her face a mask of vigilance.

As for Li Qi, he paid Shen Shuibi no mind. Although he recognized her as the foolish demon he had met before, in the end, Young Master Zhu was the one in charge here.

So he immediately bowed. "Young Master, is my mission to follow this envoy for an audience with Lady Luofu?"

"That is the case." Young Master Zhu nodded. "The causes and consequences, you two should both know, and I have already told you the objective. I cannot personally seek out Lady Luofu; I must even deliberately keep my distance. After all, a frightened bird should not be lightly disturbed."

Li Qi stood to the side with his head bowed, feigning ignorance as if he had heard nothing.

"The Lady is no frightened bird!" Shen Shuibi immediately retorted.

However, Young Master Zhu could not be bothered to pay her any mind.

Shen Shuibi's earlier words had nearly driven him mad with anger. It was better to speak less with the simple-minded.

After all, the Li Qi before him could surely deduce the situation in the Great Deer Kingdom from the clues, and perhaps even guess that a war was happening. Yet, he kept his mouth shut and said only pleasant things. Though it smacked of insincere flattery, at least it wasn't infuriating.

At this thought, a flicker of interest sparked within Young Master Zhu.

"Li Qi," he called out..

Li Qi, who had been playing dead, immediately bowed with clasped hands. "Disciple is here!"

He had quickly and cleverly adjusted his form of address. The contrast between his feigned ignorance and his current alertness was so stark it made Shen Shuibi jump.

The rabbit hopped on the spot, then glared fiercely at Li Qi, as if blaming him for the scare.

"Given the situation around the Great Deer Kingdom, many great events are likely to occur. Besides what you have already mentioned, what else have you deduced? Tell me, and if you are correct, I shall reward you," Young Master Zhu spoke thus.

Li Qi nodded, understanding in his heart that this was a test.

Although this Young Master Zhu had likely been watching him at all times and had already tested him on his way here, he must have passed for the man to appear and promise him benefits in exchange for his service.

This current question was probably a sudden thought, something specific that had occurred to him, and he had even offered a reward for it.

Well... setting aside his motives, this Young Master Zhu really was, as he himself claimed, pure and good-natured at heart... even offering a reward for answering a question.

Nevertheless, he immediately set his mind to work, contemplating what major event would be worthy of this grand figure's special inquiry.

For him to call it a major event, it must truly be significant, but it couldn't be an unexpected incident, like the emergence of some heavenly treasure.

Because that kind of thing, he had no way of knowing at all; asking Li Qi was useless.

Therefore, it must be a major event with signs visible among the common people, one that he might know about or have even inadvertently participated in... and this event must be related to the conflict between the Tang Empire and Shaman God Mountain.

What kind of major event could that be?

There wouldn't be many. A major event requiring the participation of the common folk, one that Li Qi could foresee, could only be one of two things.

The great affairs of a state are but sacrifice and war!

Sacrificial rites had little to do with the former Li Qi, and besides, that was the business of Invocators. The grandest rite Li Qi had ever participated in was the River Breaking ceremony, and it was obvious that such a thing would barely register as a major event in Young Master Zhu's eyes.

That... left only war.

Military affairs, warfare—only something of that scale could be considered a major event.

And if it was related to him...

Li Qi pondered in his brain, and soon, a clue surfaced.

Lu Shan, Big Strong Shan! The leader of the Strong Force Gang had said he was a deserter from the Song Kingdom!

The Song Kingdom bordered the Great Deer Kingdom and was situated even farther north, making it highly likely that it shared a border with the Tang Kingdom. Furthermore, Big Strong Shan had also mentioned that he fled when the Song Kingdom was being attacked by the Tang Kingdom.

The answer was suddenly obvious. Li Qi immediately replied, "I believe what the Young Master is referring to must be the war between the Tang Kingdom and the Song Kingdom, correct?"

"Not bad." Young Master Zhu nodded with satisfaction. "With your sharp mind, I have no worries about you being taken advantage of on your journey to see Lady Luofu."

"However, you were likely able to guess that because of the clues and hints from the Strong Force Gang. Now, think again, why would I have sought out the Strong Force Gang?"

Li Qi had already considered this when he figured out the previous answer, so he answered without hesitation, "I'm afraid... the Young Master intended for the Strong Force Gang to be a sacrifice from the very beginning?"

"Not at all. A sacrifice is a noble part of a rite and cannot be used lightly. How could a mere soldier of the Song Kingdom be worthy of the word 'sacrifice'? As an Invocator, you must pay attention to your choice of words in the future. Rites are the Dao of communicating with heaven, earth, and the spirits; they cannot be treated with disrespect," Young Master Zhu admonished.

However, he understood Li Qi's meaning and added, "But your guess is correct. A deserter from the Song Kingdom, one who chose to abandon his country and flee from his comrades in the face of the Tang Kingdom's attack—such a crime is punishable by death. But before his execution, I could use him to lure out the person of the Outer Dao whom I required."

As Young Master Zhu said this, he glanced at Li Qi.

Li Qi immediately lowered his head and bowed.

Indeed, Young Master Zhu might have claimed his nature was pure and good, but he never said he wouldn't kill or scheme...

Towards this new boss of his, it was still better to be a bit more cautious.

"Alright, let's not dwell on this. Since you've answered correctly again, I will give you a gift to grant you more security on your journey." As he spoke, Young Master Zhu took a willow branch from his sleeve.

He said, "You are embarking on a long journey to find Lady Luofu, and it is not convenient for me to accompany you. So, I will gift you this willow branch to see you off."

Li Qi knew it wasn't his place to ask what it was, but he was aware of the custom of breaking a willow branch as a farewell gift. Besides, it was a reward for his correct answers, so he didn't refuse. He stepped forward, accepted the willow branch, offered his thanks, and then resumed his act of playing dead, saying nothing more.

"I have tested you several times, and you have passed them all. Therefore, the mission is yours. Do a good job." Young Master Zhu patted Li Qi on the shoulder and then vanished on the spot.

Leaving Shen Shuibi and Li Qi at the spot staring wide-eyed at each other.
