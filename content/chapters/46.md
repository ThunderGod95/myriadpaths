# Chapter 46: A Sudden Premonition

"A premonition? Something bad is about to happen?" Li Qi frowned, then asked, "Is your premonition accurate?"

"Not... not very accurate. It's just a sudden whim, a feeling of unease, but I feel it must be manifesting something. Before I crippled my cultivation, I was Rank Five; my premonitions usually have some basis," Shen Shuibi said weakly.

Rank Five!

Li Qi was rendered speechless.

_Alright then... just who exactly is Lady Luofu? Even a handmaiden under her command was Rank Five._

_Sooner or later, I will be Rank Five too!_

Li Qi gritted his teeth, then returned to normal.

He thought for a moment and responded, "Better to believe it true than to assume it false. Let's go. We won't stay here."

Although he had spent the entire day building good relations just to borrow lodging in the village for the night and avoid freezing in the mountains, if there was real danger, it was better to sleep in the wild.

Li Qi had always been a decisive person; when he said go, he meant go. He immediately led Old Ma, grabbed Shen Shuibi, bade farewell to the villagers, and set off at once.

Old Ma didn't say anything either. Although he was already very weak, he didn't hesitate when told to hit the road, actively nuzzling Li Qi.

"Old Ma asks if you want him to carry the load while traveling. Although he can't run very far, he runs fast," Shen Shuibi immediately translated from the side.

Li Qi pondered briefly and nodded. "That would be best. Old Ma can take us two hundred li away, far from here. We'll find a secluded spot near water to rest."

Old Ma let out a neigh and immediately crouched down to let Shen Shuibi and Li Qi mount.

Li Qi held the back basket in his hand and sat in front. Although there was no saddle or stirrups, Old Ma knew how to adjust for bumps, making the ride effortless and ensuring he wouldn't fall off.

The reason he didn't carry the basket on his back was that Shen Shuibi had to sit behind him. Although she was once a Rank Five bigshot, right now her cultivation was completely lost, making her no different from a delicate and frail young lady. Her seat wasn't stable, and being short with short arms, she couldn't hug the horse's neck if she sat in front, so she could only sit on the back and hug Li Qi's waist.

After these arrangements, the one person, one rabbit, and one horse set off.

Old Ma was old and physically declining, and his heavy injuries hadn't healed, but he was a dragon colt after all. Carrying two people plus luggage, he still moved as if flying; cloud qi rose from beneath his hooves. Calling it running wasn't as accurate as calling it flying.

It was just that the cloud qi was thin and weak; it could only lighten his body, not allow him to fly directly.

But it still opened Li Qi's eyes.

_What a fast horse! And when flying, the cloud qi provides cover. There's actually no wind, not a single bump, and no need for flat ground. Old Ma can leap ten zhang in a single bound; ordinary mountain streams can't stop him at all._

Aside from Old Ma stopping occasionally to rest, the journey was very peaceful. Old Ma's speed was considerably fast; they had started when the sun was setting, yet before it turned fully dark, they had run over one hundred and eighty li and found a pool of water.

"Alright, let's stop here," Li Qi observed the surrounding terrain and decided on the place to stay for the night.

Old Ma hurriedly let the people down, gasping for breath with heavy huffing sounds.

It was visible that Old Ma was exhausted and covered in sweat; his body temperature had risen, and he was nearly sticking his tongue out.

Asking him to carry two people and sprint one hundred and eighty li continuously in his condition was indeed a bit harsh.

Seeing this, Li Qi took the pot he usually used to cook rice cakes, filled a basin with water by the pool, and splashed two basins over him, finally bringing Old Ma's body temperature down.

Then, Li Qi filled the pot with three or four jin of beans, sprinkled in some coarse salt, added water, and mixed it evenly, placing it before Old Ma who was lying on the ground. "Eat. Replenish your stamina. By the way, don't spit in it; I still have to use this pot later, and I eat from it too!"

Old Ma made whinnying sounds, nodding repeatedly, rubbed his face against Li Qi, and buried his head to start gnawing on the beans.

Li Qi stood watching for a while. Seeing him take a mouthful of beans and a mouthful of fresh wild grass, eating with great delight—and estimating that he had put in the right amount of salt—he turned and walked over to Shen Shuibi.

"Miss Shen, do you still have that premonition?" he asked cautiously.

Old Ma couldn't run anymore. Running over a hundred li in a straight line on these mountain roads was already the limit for his aged and injured body.

If that feeling persisted, other preparations would have to be made.

"It has weakened a lot. We should have avoided it," Shen Shuibi closed her eyes, sensed for a moment, and spoke.

Li Qi nodded. "That's good."

Having received a positive answer, although he was still somewhat uneasy, the hour was late. He planned to retrieve the pot once Old Ma finished eating, cook some rice cakes, and after eating, continue studying the [Invocation] in his mind.

_Yesterday I read about distinguishing cloud qi. Perfect, what was under Old Ma's feet earlier was also cloud qi. Let me see... the book says..._ Li Qi flipped through the [Book of Invocation] in his brain.

The book stated: "Distinguish fortune and misfortune through the five clouds; observe the portents of flood and drought, of plenty and famine; watch the twelve winds to discern the harmony and dissonance of heaven and earth, and the omens of the anomalous and auspicious."

According to this statement...

"Observe the cloud colors at the two solstices and two equinoxes: green is for insects, white is for mourning, red is for the chaos of war, black is for floods, yellow is for abundance..." Li Qi chanted what was recorded in the book while combining it with reality, wanting to observe the celestial phenomena.

He looked toward the sun.

He looked for a good long while.

_Doesn't seem like anything special._

_Can Diviners really distinguish good and bad luck based on the color of clouds?_

_Perhaps... my perspective is wrong?_

Thinking this, Li Qi activated his qi observation perspective.

Then, his vision suddenly opened up!

Taiji in chaotic profusion, primordial qi clear and refined, earth qi rising, heavenly qi entangling, floods below and mist above, poison qi steaming!

In these vast mountains, he hadn't noticed it before.

There was actually miasma and poison qi!

"Did it enter my body?" Li Qi looked at his own body.

Then, he could see that inside his body, there was surging qi keeping the external poison qi and miasma out.

These qi varied; some were vital qi, some were nutritive qi, some were defensive qi, and some were blood qi.

But these things formed an existence like a wall, firmly resisting the external elements.

"Immunity? Or something else?" Li Qi noticed these things for the first time.

_Why didn't I see them before?_

_What is the reason?_

While puzzled, he continued to focus on his body.

He discovered that although poison qi and miasma were resisted outside, there were some things that couldn't be resisted.

Li Qi carefully distinguished those he couldn't resist. Combining this with the knowledge in the book, it took a great deal of effort to finally clarify that those were actually Cold qi and Summer qi.

Cold qi and Summer qi...

_In other words, the reason I feel cold and warmth, fall ill, suffer from heatstroke, or catch a cold is because of these?_

Thinking of this, he suddenly thought of something.

He looked again at the rabbit squatting not far away, Shen Shuibi.

"As expected..." he sighed.

On this rabbit, apart from the weak nutritive qi and defensive qi on her body, he couldn't see anything.

But all the qi—whether Cold qi, Summer qi, poison qi, or miasma—was shut out.

Shen Shuibi, invaded by neither cold nor summer heat, approached by no poisons...?oached by no poisons...?
