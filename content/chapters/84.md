# Chapter 84: Distant

A big shot comparable to the East City constable?

Many of the trackers were muttering in their hearts.

But Sixth Uncle hadn't backed down, so neither did they.

At this moment, however, Sixth Uncle burst into laughter. "Hahaha, I was wondering what this was all about. Vegetable Head Zhang, oh, Vegetable Head Zhang, you should just change your name to Pig Head Zhang!"

"Use your brain and think! If that kind of big shot ordered you to ask us about some joyous occasion, could it be a trivial matter? Besides, for a gang like ours, what exactly counts as a joyous occasion?" Sixth Uncle retorted sharply.

There was no need to ask; both sides already knew the answer.

If a true big shot wanted to deal with the Wave-Rowing Gang, they wouldn't need such underhanded methods. A casual command would ensure the Wave-Rowing Gang never received another lick of work in the city.

With no work, they would simply starve to death.

Yet now, they had instructed Vegetable Head Zhang to come and talk, deliberately complicating the situation just to mention a joyous occasion...

It was obvious. The other party wanted Vegetable Head Zhang to serve as a reminder, while keeping the matter from blowing out of proportion.

"Enough, don't try to bluff me! I don't care about your Wave-Rowing Gang's business. I'm just a pawn, and everyone knows we serve different masters. Regardless, I'll leave my words here. If you don't spit out the truth about this joyous occasion, I'm afraid something terrible will happen tonight!" Vegetable Head Zhang glared, his expression fierce.

"I'd like to know exactly what is going to happen."

Right at that moment, everyone heard the voice of a young man.

Li Qi stepped forward. He was clutching a cloth-wrapped military saber, with a willow branch tied around his waist.

In the distance, upon a painted pleasure boat drifting on the Li River.

Oddly enough, there were no women on board. Although the tables were laden with wine and meat, the air lacked the scent of rouge. Instead, groups of men dressed in neat, clean clothes, each with a longsword in hand or resting at their hip, gathered in twos and threes to feast and drink.

It looked like an ordinary banquet, yet there wasn't even a single dancer to liven the mood.

Two young men sat by the ship's rail, drinking as they gazed at the nearby riverbank.

"Look, an argument must have broken out over there. I wonder if Elder Bao's calculations are accurate. Is there really ownerless metal qi resting in a place like this?" one of the young men asked with a hint of doubt.

"A place like this? This is Li Prefecture City. The East City docks might be impoverished, but who's to say a hidden dragon or crouching tiger isn't lurking around? Do you dare look down on a prefecture city? Besides, it's not just me boasting—Elder Bao is an Innate realm expert. Could his words be false?" his companion noted.

The first young man remained anxious. "It's true that Elder Bao is an Innate realm expert. But I've heard that Innate realm experts have only refined their five viscera, not their brains. Can't they still make mistakes?"

"Even if he makes a mistake, it's not our place to comment. Don't you know the capabilities of his Gold-Seeking Mouse? The only reason we return from every trip with overflowing pockets is because of it." His companion laughed at his baseless worries.

"That's exactly why I'm worried. If you walk along the river often enough, your shoes are bound to get wet. Most of the treasures in this prefecture city already have owners. For a divine weapon to suddenly appear like this... it makes me feel uneasy." The young man was full of dread.

"Stop worrying. Come, drink! Even if something happens, Elder Bao will bear the brunt of it. What do we have to fear? It's just a pity that sect rules forbid getting close to women while traveling. Otherwise..."

The two young men clinked their cups again, drinking and chatting.

Meanwhile, below them on the third floor of the painted boat, a bald middle-aged man sat inside a large private room. He controlled a tiny, golden-furred mouse, forming hand seals and muttering incantations.

After gnawing through a golden cake, the golden-furred mouse let out a series of squeaks.

The bald middle-aged man grasped the golden-furred mouse, carefully sensing its response.

"The metal qi resonates on its own. There is rootless water nearby, which is why the metal qi is leaking..." he muttered to himself, analyzing the feedback from the golden-furred mouse.

"Soon... That ownerless metal qi is nearby, and it's wrapped in baleful qi. Furthermore, the metal qi lacks an owner, meaning its master is clearly dead. It must have washed down the river after they died and been picked up by the trackers here. I'll test the waters first. If it truly is ownerless, I'll strike directly." He spoke to himself.

Although the Gold-Seeking Mouse indicated the presence of rootless water, a gang of trackers was essentially rootless water as well. It was highly likely they had merely stumbled upon that sharp weapon.

For an ownerless weapon to trigger a reaction from the Gold-Seeking Mouse—this was truly a pie falling from the sky! It might even be a graded divine weapon!

At this thought, he swept his gaze over the disciples gathered below.

_Heh. A bunch of mundane mortals._

These were all disciples of the Mount Bo Sect.

The Mount Bo Sect was a martial arts faction that practiced a Martial Dao cultivation method. But just like the vast majority of commoners, they didn't even know the true face of this world.

The stages recorded in their cultivation method were Tempering Strength, Tempering Skin, and Tempering Bone, followed by an outward-to-inward transition to Tempering Viscera.

Once all five viscera were completely tempered, they would step straight into the ranks of Innate realm martial artists.

All the disciples viewed becoming an Innate realm martial artist as their highest goal, believing that to be a first-rate expert in the mortal world.

The bald middle-aged man only smiled mockingly.

_Country bumpkins._

The so-called 'Innate' realm they spoke of was merely entering the ranks of the Martial Dao.

Rank 9 was indeed considered the level of an expert, but it was far, far removed from being first-rate in the world.

However, this was perfectly normal. How could these mundane mortals compare to someone like him, who had acquired a true immortal legacy?

His cultivation method was an authentic immortal art. Cultivated to its peak, it would allow him to step straight into Rank 7 and become a soaring immortal being. He was countless times stronger than those whose lifelong goal was merely the Innate realm.

Even now, he was a Rank 9 expert, comparable to a Innate realm martial artist. If he utilized his spell arts, he was even stronger than the sect master of the Mount Bo Sect.

Yet, he still needed the Mount Bo Sect to earn some vulgar worldly wealth, so he had to keep playing along with these mortals for a bit longer.

Just like now.

A Rank 9 divine weapon was worth over a hundred pieces of gold. Moreover, in the mortal world, money could hardly buy such a thing; it usually commanded a massive premium.

Perhaps it was a weapon belonging to a fallen soldier from the war between the Tang Empire and the Song Kingdom that had found its way here.

If it was a weapon from the Tang Empire... then its original owner must have been a Platoon Leader, or even a Flag Officer.

Though these were minor officer ranks, a single army in the Tang Empire only had a few hundred of them.

Rumor had it that every Flag Officer was a ranked expert! And each of them was issued a weapon and suit of armor matching their rank.

The wealth of the Tang Empire was evident.

Sighing with emotion, Elder Bao of the Mount Bo Sect cast his gaze into the distance once more.

If nothing happened over there, he was prepared to make his move.

A bunch of mud-legged trackers daring to hoard a Rank 9 weapon?

They were simply courting death!
