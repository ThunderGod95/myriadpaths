# Chapter 68: Negotiations

Hearing this, Li Qi felt a sudden shudder run down his spine, breaking out in a layer of goosebumps.

He hadn't sensed any aura or sound.

He immediately turned around.

The blind old woman from earlier had silently approached, leaning on her walking stick.

"I ask for Senior Brother's forgiveness. A few days ago, I cast a hexagram and divined that my son's chance of survival lay here. It was I who instructed him to do this. Though he is simple-minded, he would never intentionally harm another... Seeking you out was purely my idea," the blind old woman said in a steady tone.

"How else would he have known you were by the river conducting a ritual, Senior Brother? He went there specifically to wait," she added, fixing Li Qi with her cloudy, gray eyes.

A chill ran through Li Qi under her unblinking gaze, and he took a step back. "Why do you keep calling me Senior Brother, old timer? You're much older; just calling me Little Li will do."

He ignored her justification, pivoting the subject entirely.

He had no desire to debate the rights and wrongs of the situation; all he wanted was to get away, and quickly.

The blind old woman shook her head. "Rules are rules. Senior Brother is a proper disciple of Shaman God Mountain, whereas I am merely an outer-mountain servant who learned a few basic spell arts. When I came of age, I was sent down the mountain to find my own way. Upon meeting a Senior Brother, it is only right that I show respect."

Li Qi almost sputtered out a laugh.

"You say it's only right to show respect, yet your first move is to use a misfortune-shifting art as a show of force?" Li Qi asked.

"Although I am foolish, I can still recognize a bright pearl. Senior Brother has gained the approval of the Qiong Ox and possesses the [Book of Invocation] passed down personally by a Grand Invocator. As a direct disciple of Shaman God Mountain's main lineage, how could you be hindered by such a trivial disaster? Therefore, I boldly instructed my son to do this, all for the sake of drawing your attention. Only then could we have this conversation," the old woman explained.

While they conversed, the wealthy merchant stood to the side, trembling in fear. He scratched his ears and cheeks in anxious bewilderment, helplessly watching his mother speak with Li Qi.

"No matter your reasons, there is absolutely no room for negotiation here. Old timer, farewell." Li Qi cupped his hands in a brief salute and turned toward the door.

Cold sweat trickled down his spine.

_Damn it, I thought divination was supposed to be difficult against someone of the Outer Dao! How the hell could an unranked Diviner like her calculate my whereabouts?_

This realization sent a spike of severe anxiety through him regarding his own survival.

He had to get out of here, fast.

Li Qi had just turned to leave when the blind old woman spoke again. "My skills are meager, far inferior to Senior Brother's profound cultivation. The Dao of Divination could not calculate anything concerning you directly. But... doesn't Senior Brother wish to know how I predicted your arrival?"

Hearing this, Li Qi halted.

_Wait, so she can't actually divine my location?_

_Then how was I found?_

"Explain yourself clearly," Li Qi demanded, his tone turning cold and hard.

He mobilized his internal qi. His Carp Stream Intent gathered power, ready to erupt at a moment's notice.

The Ox Strength Art primed to activate, while he simultaneously focused on the progress bars in his surroundings.

He was already accustomed to his field of vision being cluttered with various progress bars and had learned to filter out the useless ones. Since this thing could constantly display an enemy's movements during combat, he had learned to observe the bars to predict an opponent's attack timing and interrupt them promptly.

"Senior Brother need not be nervous. I wonder, do you know the origins of that horse by your side?" she asked.

Li Qi didn't relax in the slightest, nor did he answer. He simply waited for her to continue.

The old woman seemed to anticipate his silence; though it was framed as a question, she immediately answered it herself.

"The dragon colt Lingering Shadow was once the mount of the Song Kingdom's General Liu Bosi. He is one of the finest steeds in the entire kingdom, standing eight and a half _chi_ tall at the shoulder. He can harness the clouds to soar into the sky and can even tread upon water."

"However, when the Tang Empire attacked the Song Kingdom, General Liu Bosi—despite being a Rank 7 practitioner of the Martial Dao who could cleave mountains, shatter stones, and break enemy lines—was easily toyed with by the Tang Empire's Daoist spell arts. Unable to resist their military might, he watched the Tang forces breach three prefectures in a single night. Overcome with grief and indignation, he took his own life."

"After his death, his corpse was desecrated, but the dragon colt was recognized as a true treasure. It was claimed by the Tang general who besieged the city. With Lingering Shadow's aptitude, if properly nurtured and trained, it might even transform into a true dragon in the future."

"But the dragon colt possessed high intelligence. Unwilling to serve its master's mortal enemy, it resisted with all its might."

"The Tang general then laid down a spell art to seal its bloodline and vital essence, intending to take it back and slowly break its spirit. But the seal was only half-completed before the dragon colt managed to escape."

"Furious, the Tang general ordered his men to hunt it down. The news has already spread across half of the Great Deer Kingdom. Diviners like us were even approached by special envoys, ordered to divine clues regarding Lingering Shadow's whereabouts."

"It is precisely through this connection that I was able to make indirect inquiries and deduce your location, Senior Brother. After all... you are still carrying that Rank 9 Tang blade, aren't you?"

"Piecing these clues together allowed me to guess the general situation the moment I saw you with my own eyes."

Hearing this, cold sweat nearly poured down Li Qi's face.

He knew Old Ma was being hunted by armored soldiers, leading him to suspect the horse had some status. But at the end of the day, he figured it was just an aged, weakened dragon colt—how much trouble could it really provoke? Seeing that the pursuing military officer's horse was seven feet tall, an eight-foot dragon colt shouldn't have been a huge deal, right?

But listening to this now... the trouble was massive.

_Old Ma is actually beyond his current level? Traveling eight hundred li a day, and sixteen hundred li day and night—that's only half his true speed?_

_Half of his bloodline and vital essence are sealed by a spell art?_

_I'll have to ask him when I get back._

Despite his internal panic, Li Qi maintained his composure, keeping his expression perfectly blank. Without uttering a single word, he continued to stare at the blind old woman.

The old woman didn't pause for long before continuing. "Having said this, I naturally understand that my entire family's lives are now in your hands, Senior Brother. This brings me to the terms I wish to discuss with you."

"Your cultivation is profound, Senior Brother. I tried desperately, but could not divine the slightest trace of your whereabouts. As for that fairy by your side, I couldn't even perceive her existence. If my son hadn't seen her with his own eyes, I would never have realized there was someone traveling with you. She must have reached the realm of flawless perfection."

"But every art has its specialty. As an Invocator, you likely don't possess a deep understanding of the Dao of Divination. In the future, it's highly possible that others will divine clues regarding Lingering Shadow. After all, he is coveted by a Tang general. Keeping him by your side will undoubtedly bring trouble, but sending him away means losing a steed worth a thousand gold."

"I am willing to risk this crippled life to perform a ritual that will corrupt the dragon colt's karmic threads, ensuring you suffer no future consequences."

"In return, I only beg that you take action and save my son's life."
