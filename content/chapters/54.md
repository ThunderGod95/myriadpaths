# Chapter 54: Desperate Straits

In the time it took them to mount their horses, however, Li Qi had long since vanished without a trace!

Besides, they couldn't ride their horses into the water.

Li Qi silently thanked Sixth Uncle in his heart several times over.

The Wave-Shattering Force truly provided a massive advantage against those who couldn't swim.

It was precisely by relying on this that the Wave-Rowing Gang remained safe. After all, while both the Strong Force Gang and the Water Horse Gang were formidable in a fight, as long as they were in the water, the Wave-Rowing Gang stood invincible.

He drifted effortlessly downstream.

The ceaseless clatter of hooves echoed behind him. Occasionally, the riders would even surge ahead, attempting to intercept him.

The soldiers refused to give up, swearing to sever his head!

However, amidst these pitch-black mountain paths, Li Qi's downstream journey was like traveling on an open highway—a luxury their horses simply could not match.

If they had been riding a dragon colt like Old Ma—capable of leaping ten zhang in a single bound—or even a horse wreathed in cloud qi that allowed it to soar, Li Qi absolutely would not have been able to escape.

But the mounts these men rode were merely ordinary spirit horses.

Leaping three zhang was already their absolute limit, let alone ten.

Therefore, while their gallop through the mountain forests was not slow, keeping pace with the winding river proved exceedingly difficult.

If the river had flowed in a straight line, Li Qi certainly couldn't have outpaced them.

But... these were the mountains, and there were waterfalls.

Whenever Li Qi encountered a waterfall—even one ten zhang high—he dared to dive straight down. After all, there were deep pools waiting at the bottom.

In his past life, professional divers dared to leap from ten-meter platforms, and his current physique was more than twenty times stronger than theirs. Not to mention, he had the toughened hide granted by the Ox Strength Art to mitigate the impact. As long as he didn't crash directly onto submerged rocks, he would be fine!

If the bottom of the waterfall truly was entirely covered in rocks, with water too shallow for a person to even stand...

Then he would just have to accept his fate!

He was fleeing for his life, after all. Was there truly such a thing as a foolproof plan?

Li Qi had always been like this: before an event occurred, he would undoubtedly rack his brains to consider every possibility, arranging all avenues of retreat and contingency plans, making him appear almost indecisive.

But once he truly began to act, he was absolutely resolute, never hesitating.

When it was time to risk his life, he risked it!

It wasn't his first time putting his life on the line, so what was there to fear?

He dared to leap down a ten-zhang waterfall, but his pursuers did not.

They were riding horses!

If they jumped, what if the horses broke their legs? What if they plummeted to their deaths?

Thus, even as they gritted their teeth in hatred, they were forced to take detours, needing to find gentle slopes to descend before continuing their pursuit along the riverbank.

They wanted to see just how far this bastard could swim!

However, they had forgotten one crucial detail.

This was Baiyue.

Here lay the Hundred Thousand Mountains.

The intricate mountains, valleys, and water veins formed a complex, web-like river system. Countless streams and creeks meandered and spread out, mimicking the sprawling root systems of the undergrowth.

The moment they detoured, letting Li Qi slip out of their line of sight for even a minute, he would immediately change course.

Was this not just a deadly game of hide-and-seek?

Bring it on!

Let's see who had more experience traversing this terrain: a bunch of horse-riding soldiers who clearly hailed from the plains, or Li Qi, a veteran tracker!

Li Qi refused to believe they could still track him under these circumstances.

After leaping down at least four waterfalls and swimming for roughly twenty li, Li Qi still had energy to spare, and the sound of hooves behind him had grown exceedingly faint.

He had swum twenty li in the water, but those men had been forced to detour for at least a hundred.

This was the reality of mountain terrain.

The straight-line distance might appear short, but once the chase began, the sheer number of twists and turns meant that—unless you could fly—you had better be prepared to circle an entire mountain just to cross a gap that seemed mere inches away.

This was normal deep within the Hundred Thousand Mountains.

Two villages could echo each other from afar; a shout from one peak could be heard clearly on the next.

But walking from one village to the other could take an entire day.

Such was the rugged nature of the mountain roads.

This geographical trait had done Li Qi a massive favor.

Roughly forty-five minutes later, Li Qi finally dragged himself from the river.

He was bruised and battered all over, his limbs weak and aching, his entire being utterly spent.

His first overwhelming sensation was the cold.

Initially, the sheer exertion of his escape had caused his body to radiate heat, masking the chill.

But Li Qi had overlooked one critical point: this world possessed qi.

The flowing water veins gathered cold qi, which had gradually forced its way into his blood, freezing him until he trembled uncontrollably. It felt as though ice had formed within the very marrow of his bones, and even his balls had painfully shriveled up into his body.

Had he stayed in the water for another fifteen minutes, he feared he would have frozen to the point of suffering permanent damage, dooming him to a future without sons.

The second sensation was pure exhaustion.

Bone-deep exhaustion.

His muscles refused to obey his commands, twitching and trembling sporadically. He could no longer stand up straight.

His three daily uses of the Ox Strength Art had long been depleted. Without its support, swimming at full strength for that long would have been absolutely impossible.

Only someone who had experienced it could comprehend the sheer physical toll.

A triathlon in his past life only required swimming seven li, but Li Qi had just swum at least sixty.

Furthermore, his speed had vastly exceeded that of a triathlete, and he had survived multiple dives from heights of dozens of meters.

This intense physical exertion had completely drained all the qi from Li Qi's body.

Cold and fatigued, Li Qi lacked even the strength to roll over, left to sprawl on the riverbank and gasp for breath.

He felt like a thoroughly dead fish.

_I should have... escaped by now, right?_ Li Qi thought, his consciousness blurring.

He was too tired. He reckoned he had likely damaged his primordial Qi this time.

However, it was not over yet.

"Little thief... you bastard, your grandpa has caught you now, hasn't he...?" A voice just as feeble as his own drifted over.

Li Qi immediately forced himself to focus and glanced to the side.

Then, he saw a soldier with a broken leg, leaning heavily on a long saber, limping toward him.

He had no horse; who knew what had happened to his mount.

His visage was as ferocious as an evil spirit's, and the injury to his leg was severe, with jagged bone shards piercing through the skin.

Taking one look, Li Qi instantly knew that this man had undoubtedly spurred his horse off a cliff in a desperate bid to catch up, plummeting the steed to its death and shattering his own leg in the process.

A waterfall with such a substantial drop was punishing enough even when crashing into deep water. If there had been rocks at the bottom, surviving the fall meant this soldier's physique was truly formidable, especially considering he was clad in heavy armor.

That was no small feat.

However, Li Qi merely sighed.

Although the enemy was an arrow at the end of its flight, how was Li Qi faring any better?

The man might have a broken leg, but he could at least still support himself enough to walk and grip a blade.

Li Qi also had a blade in hand—the one left behind by the commanding officer.

It was undeniably superior to the soldier's weapon.

But Li Qi could no longer lift it; he couldn't even manage to roll over.

Still... surrendering without a fight was absolutely not in Li Qi's nature!

His hands and feet trembled, rendering him unable to stand. Yet, mustering a final breath, he forced himself into a half-seated position. With arms as limp as noodles, he drew the long saber and leveled it at the approaching soldier.

Despite being unable to stand—forced to sit while using the blade as a diagonal crutch against the ground just to stay upright—Li Qi's eyes widened with fierce, burning anger as he glared straight at his pursuer!

Come on! If you want my life, come and take it!

Let's see if I can drag you to hell with me!

Li Qi wore a savage expression. Abandoning all regard for his own life, he fully intended to drag the enemy down into mutual destruction!

Or, failing that, he hoped his sheer ferocity would force the opponent to hesitate, creating a standoff and buying himself precious time.
