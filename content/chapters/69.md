# Chapter 69: Analysis

Li Qi's expression remained calm, as if he were completely unfazed.

But his mind was racing.

_The dragon colt Lingering Shadow... is that Old Ma's real name?_

_Old Ma was the mount of a Song Kingdom general? A horse worth a thousand gold that caught the eye of a Tang Empire general, who wanted to tame him, but he escaped?_

_And right now, this Tang general is trying to retrieve him and has hired a whole batch of Diviners to do it._

Li Qi had been ignorant of such matters before, but he hadn't been idle. Ever since the soldiers hunted him, he had asked Shen Shuibi extensively about the military system so he could better gauge an enemy's strength.

The rank of "General" actually wasn't considered the absolute pinnacle. The Tang Empire's military was roughly divided into Marshal, Guard General, General, Field Officer, and Troops, with clearly defined tiers.

A squad consisted of five men, led by a squad leader.

Two to ten squads formed a platoon of ten to fifty men, led by a platoon leader or flag officer.

Several platoons formed a battalion of one to five hundred men, overseen by a commandant.

Several battalions formed a garrison, which varied in size and was usually established for temporary legion encampments under a captain.

Several garrisons made up an army, which consisted of at least ten thousand men. A General, therefore, was the commander of an army of at least ten thousand soldiers.

To command an army of that size, a General's personal strength had to be extraordinary. If the defeated Song Kingdom's general was a Rank Seven... wouldn't the victorious Tang general be even more formidable?

_An expert among Rank Sevens? Or perhaps... a Rank Six?_

Li Qi figured that right now, he could lift a boulder weighing twenty to thirty thousand catties, effortlessly beat dozens of strong men to death, and moreover, his thick skin was invulnerable to blades and spears. If he prepared well, wiping out a mundane street gang would be a breeze.

Yet, in truth, he hadn't even entered the ranks yet.

He had fought and killed a Rank Nine, but only because the other party had expended most of his power severing the mountain root and water veins. Li Qi had also ambushed him with a willow branch, damaging his divine soul. Furthermore, they had fought underwater, giving Li Qi a massive geographical advantage, especially since the enemy had stripped off his heavy armor just to dive in.

Only by stacking all these advantages was Li Qi able to pull off the kill—and he still nearly died afterward. If Shen Shuibi hadn't used her Unsullied Body as a barrier to block the Nether Court's Yin qi, he would have perished without a doubt.

_So, what kind of terrifying level is Rank Six?_

_Is it like the Chief Commander of the Li Prefecture Martial Defense Corps, where a single horizontal slash can stop the flow of the Li River?_

Being targeted by someone like that was a death sentence.

_Can this Diviner be trusted?_

Absolutely not. He would never put his faith in someone who tossed a curse at him as a greeting.

She claimed that by combining known clues with seeing him in person, she deduced he was the one who had taken the dragon colt and killed a Rank Nine soldier.

This might be true, but she was definitely hiding something. At the very least, she had to possess other clues to make such a specific leap in logic.

_However, when all is said and done... we can still cooperate._

Compared to a Rank Six general, the Diviner before him was obviously much weaker and far more manageable. That made negotiation possible.

As long as he stayed vigilant, if the negotiations broke down... he could just kill her.

With this thought, Li Qi made his decision.

However, he didn't agree directly. Instead, he shook his head. "I can naturally find other Diviners to do this. I don't need you."

"If one wishes to sever karmic ties without resorting to blood-defiling spell arts, one must hire a Diviner of Rank Seven or above. Senior Brother, although your status is high, enlisting such an expert is no easy task, is it?" she countered, her logic airtight.

"...You seem to understand the situation well. But given your previous stunt, I cannot trust you," Li Qi said with a sigh.

"No matter. Then how about I earn your trust first? Senior Brother, go and fetch that blade. I will remove its karmic threads so no one can track it via divination. Afterward, you can listen to me recount the bizarre anomaly my son encountered. How does that sound?" The old woman remained completely calm and at ease.

"Fine." Li Qi had to admit her proposal made a lot of sense.

_Since it's like this, I might as well give it a try._

_I'll hear out her problem first._

_If things go south, I'll just run._

With the matter settled, Li Qi turned to face her fully. "In that case, I won't take advantage of you, old timer. You might as well tell me what problem you need me to resolve."

The blind old woman bowed deeply. "Many thanks, Senior Brother."

She then grabbed her bewildered son, forcing the wealthy merchant to bow alongside her.

"Don't be in such a hurry to bow. Tell me what the issue is first," Li Qi said.

"Do you not want me to resolve the blade's karmic connections before we speak?" she asked.

"There's no need. Negotiations are easier when both sides show a little sincerity," Li Qi replied, shaking his head.

"Very well, then I shall begin." The old woman nodded. "This matter started half a year ago."

Li Qi listened carefully.

While the immediate crisis began half a year ago, its true origins traced back thirty years.

The wealthy merchant, whose surname was Wang, originally belonged to a landlord family near Yi County.

The Wang family weren't major landlords; they only possessed a little over a hundred _mu_[^1] of farmland. They farmed a portion themselves and hired tenant farmers to work the rest. They lived comfortably, yielding several hundred _dan_[^2] of grain a year. Between what they consumed and what they sold, they pulled in an annual income of seventy to eighty thousand coins.

To put that in perspective, this single family's income was roughly equivalent to the annual earnings of the entire Wave-Rowing Gang, which boasted over two hundred members.

However, seventy or eighty thousand coins definitely couldn't afford a massive residence like this one.

To purchase a sprawling, three-courtyard estate like this, one would need at least thirty or forty gold pieces—around four hundred thousand coins.

And that was just for the deed, not factoring in furniture, renovations, or hiring servants.

The Wang family's true rise to prosperity occurred when the daughter of the family caught the eye of a Diviner and was brought to Shaman God Mountain.

Unfortunately, cultivation ultimately relies on innate talent. After decades of training, she failed to officially enter the ranks. With no other choice, she packed her bags and returned home.

At this point in the story, the blind old woman cast an envious glance at Li Qi.

Noticing her gaze, Li Qi felt a twinge of perplexity.

_Is my own talent... actually that good?_

Barring any accidents, he was on track to become a ranked Invocator within a year, having experienced practically zero bottlenecks along the way.

According to the [Book of Invocation], Invocators with poor talent and low sensitivity to divinities and qi could perform sacrifices endlessly without ever receiving a single response.

Yet he seemed to trigger a response every single time. Even when he arbitrarily modified elements of a ritual, the divinities almost always answered his call.

He had previously assumed his talent was just 'not bad.' But hearing the old woman's story framed things differently.

His talent was... outrageously good.

Li Qi didn't let his realization show. Tucking his thoughts away, he continued to listen to the story.

Although the Wang family's daughter had failed to enter the ranks, she had still learned a few basic spell arts. Upon returning home, she utilized the Diviners' methods for forecasting good and ill fortune to scheme for wealth on behalf of her family.

Unsurprisingly, the Wang family's financial luck flourished, and they rapidly amassed a fortune.
