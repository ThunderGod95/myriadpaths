# Chapter 66: Azure Splendor Palace

The most commonly worshipped divinities were, in fact, those of Heaven, Earth, and Water.

Heaven referred to the Heavenly Gods of the four seasons, while Earth and Water referred to the local mountain gods, earth gods, water gods, and the like, all of which belonged to the Earthly Divinities.

This was because the four seasons, the mountains, and the waters were essential for the livelihood of the people. Without them, humanity could not survive, and so they were regarded with constant reverence and worshipped with pious prostration.

For example, the rituals in the [Book of Invocation] state: "To sacrifice to Heaven, burn firewood. To sacrifice to mountains and great rivers, raise up offerings. To sacrifice to rivers, sink them. To sacrifice to the Earth, bury them."

Water was the very blood and qi of the earth, flowing like its veins and meridians.

Water was the standard of all things and the essence of all life. It was the substance of right and wrong, gain and loss. This was why there was nowhere it did not fill and nowhere it did not reside, gathering in heaven and earth while hiding within all creation—born from metal and stone, and collecting within all living beings.

This fundamental nature of water thus determined the characteristics of the divinities known as the water gods.

The water gods were responsible for transporting the resources of heaven and earth. They acted as a bloodline to regulate the qi across different regions, maintaining the vitality of heaven and earth.

These were all things stated in the [Book of Invocation].

In terms of Li Qi's own understanding, this meant that the water cycle was very important.

This point was universally applicable in both worlds.

When sacrificing to the water gods, one had to praise these merits, honoring water for washing away stale qi and bringing fresh qi, thereby enabling all things to cycle and multiply endlessly.

The sacrifice Li Qi had arranged was exactly this kind of ritual.

Beating the fish-skin drum, ten people sang praises loudly, while Li Qi, acting as the Invocator, stepped forward to offer the invocation and preside over the ceremony.

Passersby grew curious; some gathered to watch, while others simply observed as they walked.

Li Qi paid them no mind, focusing intently on presiding over the ceremony.

Burning the spices.

Beating the fish-skin drum.

Releasing the paper boats, which bore the sacrificial offerings.

One paper boat held meat, another carried the gold, the third bore the mane of the dragon colt, and the fourth contained a cup of yellow wine. A lit white candle was placed on the fifth boat to guide the way before it was sent out into the river.

White candles were extremely expensive, costing a hundred coins apiece.

As he sent it off, Li Qi's heart bled at the expense.

But he couldn't let it show.

He waited until everything was completed, confirming that the ceremony's progress bar had perfectly reached one hundred percent.

Li Qi was extremely careful from beginning to end, for this small-scale sacrificial ceremony was something he had only managed to host after spending over three thousand coins. Apart from the two thousand three hundred coins in material and labor costs, there was also that piece of gold worth a thousand coins.

After confirming that everything was completed, Li Qi drank the portion of wine that belonged to the Invocator.

Closing his eyes, he began to channel the unique method of the Invocator.

Indeed, a ritual like this—a simple sacrifice—would have no effect on its own; it would merely be an offering to a divinity.

But an Invocator was not someone who merely made offerings to divinities.

Having read nearly three percent of the [Book of Invocation], Li Qi had already profoundly understood this point.

An Invocator was responsible for negotiating terms with divinities—a broker among the gods and a bridge for dialogue between humanity and the divine. They used sacrifices as a medium for dialogue and transaction, communicating with the divinities to exchange what they had for what they lacked.

The Invocators of Shaman God Mountain were never servants to the divinities, nor would they ever engage in blind devotion.

Drinking his second cup of wine to the rhythm of the drum, he opened his eyes wide and stared at the paper boats.

A tiny whirlpool had abruptly appeared within the river.

The whirlpool swallowed the boat with the candle, followed by the other four, gradually engulfing them one by one.

Some onlookers stared at the gold, their eyes green with envy.

Others mocked Li Qi from the sidelines, calling him a fool for throwing real gold into the river.

A few even jumped directly into the water, intending to dive into the current and dredge up the treasure.

After all, this was an unofficial, private sacrifice held publicly on the banks of the Li River, so the presence of such ignorant onlookers was perfectly normal.

Li Qi ignored them all. He simply watched the paper boats vanish into the whirlpool before drinking the third and final cup of wine.

Thump.

Thump.

Thump—!

The laborer beside him struck three consecutive drumbeats.

As the fish-skin drum echoed, Li Qi suddenly felt the water qi within his body grow restless!

This was the inner qi refined from the Carp Stream Intent!

He seemed to have developed a subtle connection with the river before him.

A strange intuition washed over him.

Following this intuition, he stepped forward and leaped into the river.

But instead of plunging into water, he felt as though he had stepped through a portal.

In an instant, heaven and earth were cut off!

The surface of the river was no longer the river channel of Yi County.

Gone was the muddy riverbed beneath the water.

Taking its place were countless palace gates, stretching from the riverbed all the way up, piercing straight into the firmament. Yet, above the firmament, it seemed as if the water's surface still remained, with endless currents enveloping this entire realm.

Gold and silver palaces filled his vision, their crystalline light blindingly bright. Within the courtyards, branching corals bloomed with pearl, Qiong, and agate flowers—a dazzling array of breathtaking treasures.

Though clearly submerged, overlapping pavilions stretched out in endless, broadening layers. There were no less than several hundred tiers—some concealed behind intricate window lattices, others surrounded by carved balustrades. The five-colored crystalline light was overwhelming, with countless jewels displaying bizarre and wondrous phenomena.

Shadows of islands swayed within the waves, their verdant and emerald hues overlapping in a way no unparalleled painter could ever capture. Exotic aquatic birds and fishes drifted past, swaying their tails in a magnificent panorama that stretched beyond the horizon.

Even as a man from a modern world, Li Qi had never witnessed such a magnificent scene!

_What is this place?_

_Azure Splendor Palace?_

A passage of text instantly popped into Li Qi's mind, something Shen Shuibi had said when introducing Mount Luofu.

"Mount Luofu is located within a grotto-heaven. The Dao is fundamentally rooted in nothingness; yet, from the indistinct and elusive, the essence of all things comes into being. The primordial unity marks the beginning, riding the cycles of change to divide into distinct forms. Spiritual manifestations profoundly emerge, arraying palaces and watchtowers amidst the pristine scenery. Profound substances silently condense, opening cave abodes in famed mountains. Its heavenly realms overlap, and its spiritual phenomena are varied—vastly different from the mortal realm."[^1]

This place felt completely detached from the mortal world; it was a true fairyland.

It reminded him of a line from his earlier sacrificial invocation—the one stating that the God of the Li River resided within Azure Splendor Palace.

_Could this place be the Azure Splendor Palace?_

However, before he could fully appreciate the scene, a shooting star plummeted from the sky.

It struck him dead-on.

Li Qi had no time to react; he hadn't even noticed it!

The direct impact sent a wave of dizziness crashing over him, and he instinctively swam toward the surface.

"Phew—!" He breached the surface, discovering that he had already returned to the river channel of Yi County.

That dreamy scene from just a moment ago seemed like an illusion.

However, Li Qi let out a long breath of relief.

He knew it was no illusion.

Because, within his body, thirty full wisps of pure water qi were currently circulating alongside his nutritive and defensive qi.

The sacrifice was complete!

    This passage expounds upon the creation of grotto-heavens. While the Dao is formless and void, from this emptiness arises the essence of all things. Primordial energy moves in accordance with the natural laws of change, manifesting individual, physical forms out of the vacuum.

    As this energy assumes a profound and observable nature, it constructs the celestial architecture of the immortal realms, thereby opening the sacred cave abodes within the mountains.
