# Chapter 50: Calamity of War

"There is indeed dragon qi here. The villagers were right; those two people and their horse must have headed this way," a mounted soldier reported to his officer.

"If so, that traveling merchant must have stumbled upon the dragon colt, recognized it as a treasure, and decided to take it along. Tsk, reckless fools. Do they not consider whose property it is before laying their hands on it?" The officer smiled, having deduced the rough sequence of events.

Suspecting that human qi had interfered with their divination, they had scoured every village within a five-hundred-li radius.

There were two settlements in total. In the more populated one, a very strange traveling merchant had appeared today.

Though he called himself a merchant, the man's behavior was bizarre. Not only was he traveling with a frail-looking woman who couldn't swat a fly, but he was also leading an injured, sickly old horse.

He claimed he was there to trade for beans to feed the beast.

The officer knew better. Anyone taking a horse on a long journey would prepare fodder—or even medicinal pills—well in advance.

Steeds were precious, large, and ravenous. Who would rely on scrounging for supplies in the middle of a long trek? What good would common village beans do anyway?

A dragon colt certainly wouldn't eat such garbage. To properly care for one required medicinal pills, spirit herbs, and even rare ores and spirit stones.

It was not a beast an ordinary person could afford to keep.

Yet here was a man leading an injured dragon colt, feeding it nothing but wild grass and common soybeans.

There was no doubt; it had to be the exact dragon colt they were hunting.

Thus, they continued to track the traces. Upon discovering hoofprints, they swiftly advanced in the direction the dragon colt had fled.

"Squad Leader, we've found the trail! They must be on that mountain ahead!" a soldier shouted.

"Move out. Pick up the pace," the officer commanded.

"Are we not waiting for the others?" a soldier asked.

As he spoke, he glanced around. Of their original ten brothers, only five remained by his side.

The other five had stayed behind to clean up.

Clean up what, exactly?

They were deep behind enemy lines, having infiltrated all the way into Great Deer. How could they pass up the chance to cull some of the Great Deer Kingdom's populace?

"We'll wait. Two mere villages shouldn't take them long; a thousand peasants hardly take any time at all to slaughter." The officer waved his hand dismissively. Since they had pinned down the dragon colt's location, they were in no immediate rush.

It was two hundred li away at most. They would reach it tonight no matter what.

A short while later, five black-armored cavalrymen emerged from the darkness.

"Squad Leader, it's done. There were two Shamans guarding the settlement—one unranked and one Rank 9. We slew them both. Here are their heads." The leading soldier dismounted and stepped forward, offering up two severed heads with both hands.

"Excellent. Slaying cultivators earns the five of you a commendation. Salt the heads properly; I will personally report this to the merit officer when we return," the officer praised.

"Thank you, Squad Leader!" The five hastily cupped their fists in salute before stowing away the bloody trophies.

Had Li Qi been present, he would have instantly recognized one of the faces. It belonged to the Spirit Medium from the village he had traded with that very afternoon.

"Let us ride. With the loose ends tied up and two heads to our name, retrieving that dragon colt will guarantee us a flawless record upon our return. We will be richly rewarded!" The officer declared, cracking his riding crop.

With a sharp crack, the steeds neighed, and the party of men surged forward, racing in the direction of the dragon colt.

Meanwhile, on the other side of the mountain, Li Qi mentally berated himself for being utterly useless while frantically preparing for the worst.

Why useless? Because he had volunteered for the night watch to keep an eye out for enemies, only to spot absolutely nothing for half the night. Yet, Shen Shuibi, who had been sound asleep, had heard them coming.

_I'm really... so pathetic._

However, since the pursuers had caught up, he was the only one left to delay them.

He had sent Old Ma away with Shen Shuibi. Neither of them had any combat ability, so there was no reason for them to stay.

Li Qi stood near the foot of the mountain, directly beneath the cliff where the altar sat. He finalized his preparations while carefully weighing his words.

If he could somehow talk his way out of this, they wouldn't have to fight.

There was no need to risk his life if a silver tongue could resolve the issue. Fighting was dangerous; Li Qi much preferred using his brain.

Even so... he had to be ready for anything.

A silver tongue could solve problems, but only if the enemy's blade didn't solve _you_ first.

If a blade took your life, no amount of smooth talking would matter.

He waited for barely fifteen minutes.

Then, he saw them.

A squadron of black-armored cavalry!

Every single one of them was mounted!

They were clad in full suits of armor engraved with intricate patterns. The armor was pitch-black, exuding a menacing, baleful qi.

The riders carried long sabers strapped to their backs, hefted heavy spears, and had light crossbows slung at their hips—a deadly arsenal for long-, mid-, and close-range combat. Their towering warhorses stood at least six feet tall, with the leading officer mounted on a massive seven-foot beast.

While not quite as massive as Old Ma, the steeds were young, robust, and brimming with vitality, projecting a terrifying majesty.

Merely looking at their formation made Li Qi swallow hard.

_Damn it... the crimson cloud really did signify the calamity of war._

He had expected bandits or outlaws. How the hell was he facing a regular army?

Furthermore, with equipment like that, this was no ordinary detachment. They were elite troops.

This truly was a literal 'calamity of war.'

Gripping a rock tightly in his hand, Li Qi braced himself and stepped aside.

_Perhaps they are merely passing through? If they just ride past, all the better._

Li Qi hoped against hope.

Obviously, it was wishful thinking.

The ten cavalrymen—radiating killing intent, with two severed heads dangling from one of their saddles—were clearly not to be trifled with. Upon spotting Li Qi, they hauled their mounts to a halt.

The troop did not advance rashly. Instead, one of the riders spurred his horse forward to approach.

"You there! Why are you loitering in the wilderness in the dead of night?" the soldier demanded.

Li Qi forced himself to shiver, his voice trembling pitifully. "M-my lords... this lowly one is but a traveling merchant camping out for the night. When I saw your esteemed presence approach, I hurried to stand, terrified I might block your path."

"A traveling merchant?" The soldier furrowed his brow. He wheeled his horse around and rode back to murmur a few words to the officer.

Realization flashed in the officer's eyes. Spurring his mount forward, he stopped ten paces from Li Qi, adopting an amiable smile. "Little brother, you claim to be a merchant. Tell me, did you happen to stumble upon a stray horse recently?"

Li Qi’s blood ran cold.

_Just as I thought. They’re here for Old Ma._

_Then... should I hand Old Ma over? Would that buy my safety?_ The thought briefly flashed through his mind.

However, he immediately suppressed the idea.

Impossible. Old Ma's horrific injuries were undoubtedly the handiwork of these very men. Handing the beast over would be a death sentence.

Li Qi had grown quite fond of Old Ma over the past few days. Furthermore, the steed was his key to finding Lady Luofu. He could not abandon him.

In that case...

"This lowly one... has seen no such thing, my lord," Li Qi stammered, attempting to play dumb.

But before the words had even left his mouth, the officer unslung his crossbow, raised it, and fired!
