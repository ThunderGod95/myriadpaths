# Chapter 77: Intimidation

Within the special space constructed by the ritual, Li Qi and the ghost stood in opposition.

Although the ghost did not appear particularly fiendish, it adamantly insisted that the entire Wang family must die before it would relent.

Li Qi's stance was neither yielding nor aggressive, but he flatly refused to agree to the ghost's demands.

After several rounds of circular arguments, the ghost seemed to lose its patience. It expanded its form and issued a chilling voice. "Invocator... do you wish to be buried alongside the Wang family?"

Li Qi cupped his hands. "Departed one, it is best to forgive when possible. Since the Wang family has already agreed not to touch your tomb again, and is willing to spend heavily to purchase yin wood and hire a master craftsman to carve you a wooden body to mend your deficiencies, I have also promised to sacrifice millet and sorghum for you. Coupled with the five pure beverages and bright water to reciprocate with Yin qi, even if your grave had been relocated, this should more than make up for it."

"It was merely a single strike of a hoe. The departed is being somewhat narrow-minded." Li Qi's words now carried a hint of temper.

Then, the ghost erupted in fury. "They dug up my grave! Yet you blame me for being narrow-minded! That is only because it was not your grave they dug! You biased Invocator, I will kill you along with them—!"

But before its voice could fade, a sudden clap of thunder resounded through the air!

_Boom!_ A heaven-shaking thunderbolt crashed!

Amidst the chaos, starlight mist propped up the celestial river, descending with a majestic stride. Thunder surged from the ethereal waves, and dazzling light manifested as lightning. The terrified ghost staggered back four or five steps, panic-stricken and uncertain. It looked around warily, not knowing where the thunder had originated.

But upon closer inspection, it realized that the thunder and lightning were actually produced by the long whip held in the Invocator's hand!

In this space formed by the ritual's connection to divine soul consciousness, the Invocator violently cracked his long whip. The sound of the whip was like thunder, and its shadow like lightning, echoing through the starry expanse. As the whip struck the void, countless motes of light scattered like stardust, resembling a descending galaxy.

Li Qi held the willow branch, cracking it through the air like a whip.

The sheer momentum was terrifyingly loud, startling even him.

It went without saying that the ghost opposite him was even more terrified, shocked into a daze as it retreated.

Seizing the opportunity, Li Qi struck while the iron was hot. With eyes widened in anger, he stepped forward and gripped the willow branch tightly.

"You greedy dead thing! A carved body of yin wood—even the Grand Tutor of the past only received such treatment! You occupy this treasured land of feng shui, and with my sacrifice nourishing your Yin qi, not to mention reincarnating, even if you clung to life and wished to cultivate as a ghost, it would be no issue!"

At this point, Li Qi cupped his hands toward the heavens, his aura imposing. "The duty of an Invocator lies in harmonizing humans, ghosts, and gods. I came adhering to my duties, wishing to mediate the conflict between you and the Wang family. After all, the Wang family was disrespectful first, but now they have exhausted their wealth, which can be considered venting your frustration. Yet, the departed acts aggressively, demanding the Wang family be buried with you, and even threatens to kill me! Do you truly believe the people of Shaman God Mountain lack a temper?!"

With that, he waved the willow branch again, cracking it like a whip. Thunder instantly roared, terrifying the ghost into a huddled ball.

"Mediation must be fair and just, without bias! You continue to pressure me. Are you trying to threaten me with force, to make me abandon justice and side with a ghost!?"

Li Qi shouted the question!

He puffed out his chest aggressively. Gripping the willow branch, he stood tall and proud, unleashing a flawless torrent of scolding upon the ghost.

However, after finishing his tirade, he tied the willow branch back around his waist, restoring his previously composed demeanor. "Departed one, I have also come bearing the duties of an Invocator, and I will not favor any side. Please do not approach this with fury; otherwise, I am afraid none of us will be pleased."

The ghost trembled in place. After a long while, it mumbled, "...The Invocator's justice is admirable. However, the reason I am so furious is that there are still hidden circumstances regarding this matter. There is something the Wang family has not told you..."

Seeing that the ghost had softened its tone, Li Qi knew his display of anger had worked. Thus, he calmed down as well. "If that is truly the case, please reveal the full picture, departed one. I will inevitably uphold justice and negotiate a suitable conclusion for both of you."

"Then I will trouble the Invocator... This matter must be explained starting from the layout of the mountains and rivers—"

And so, the ghost began to recount its tale.

As it turned out, this ghost named Elder Li was once an eclectic cultivator of the Great Deer Kingdom.

These so-called 'eclectic cultivators' were, in fact, people who managed to cobble together a flawed cultivation method by researching and pondering over scavenged texts, most of which were fragmented or even entirely fake.

In the past, various Daoist traditions had 'spread widely across the world,' leaving behind countless fragments among the common populace. These individuals occasionally came into contact with a portion of these fragments, thereby stepping onto the path of cultivation.

Elder Li was just such an exceptionally talented and extremely lucky individual. His cultivation method was a chaotic amalgamation of three Daoist Traditions—the Martial Dao, the Shaman Dao, and the Daoist sects—which he had mashed together into an unrecognizable mess.

Such a cultivation method contained intrinsic contradictions. Therefore, even though he was a genius, he could only cultivate to Rank Eight in his lifetime, and the most inferior Rank Eight at that. The various types of qi within his body were haphazardly mixed, causing his personal cosmos to lose balance, leading to his premature demise.

A normal Rank Eight cultivator on a pure Martial Dao path would possess vigorous blood qi and refined internal organs, capable of living up to one hundred and sixty years with abundant vital energy.

One purely of the Daoist Sects would have learned the harmonious union of the dragon and tiger, successfully cultivating innate Qi, and could live to be two hundred and seventy years old.

One purely of the Shaman Dao would have already nurtured inner gods within their personal cosmos, their lifespan matching that of minor deities, enabling them to live for three hundred years.

However, his personal cosmos was unbalanced, and he perished in his mere fifties or sixties.

However, he remained unwilling to accept his fate.

Incorporating the cultivation methods of both the Shaman Dao and the Daoist Sects, he devised a plan. He sought out a treasured land of feng shui to construct a layout that 'concealed the eight winds outwardly, and secreted the five elements inwardly.' This way, the tomb's interior would align perfectly with the four cardinal and four intercardinal directions, complete and without gaps, allowing the vital qi of the five elements to naturally secret within and condense.

With the vital qi of the five elements and his intact corpse, he could silently condense a yin spirit within. In the future, he might even successfully cultivate the Ghost Dao. Though he would no longer be his former self, he could maintain his consciousness and live a second life.

But that single strike of the Wang family's hoe had breached the tomb's perfect seal.

"My layout concealing the five elements was broken. Coupled with the mountain roots and water veins outside, water now floods the burial ground. The five elements are unbalanced, and the abundant water qi extinguishes the fire and soaks the wood. Seeing a century of planning fall short of success at the final stage, how could I not be furious? I was incensed earlier and failed to reveal the truth, which was my discourtesy, but I implore the Invocator's understanding..."

"As for carving wood into a body, my own corpse remains intact, so I have no need for such things. It was simply my previous arrogance that made me blind to the Invocator's painstaking efforts. I was highly disrespectful in my speech, and I am truly ashamed."

Having been thoroughly intimidated by Li Qi, the ghost spoke much more softly.

After hearing this, Li Qi was struck by a sudden realization, while simultaneously feeling a surge of pleasant surprise in his heart!

"So that is how it is!" He suppressed his inward joy and maintained his previous tone. "Then my proposal of carving a wooden body was presumptuous on my part. Since the departed's body is intact, it is naturally unnecessary."

"However, looking at the situation now, I do happen to have a way to restore the departed's five elements layout. How about you leave that excess water qi for me to handle?"

Are you kidding?! The cultivation of the Carp Stream Intent most desperately needed water qi. Wasn't this an absolute steal!
