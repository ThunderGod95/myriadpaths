# Chapter 70: Entering the Ranks

Making money as a cultivator was undoubtedly much easier than for an ordinary person.

In the past, Li Qi had pulled boats for over two years without saving a single coin, remaining entirely destitute.

Now, he could earn six or seven thousand coins just by hunting in the wilderness.

The same held true for the blind old woman.

With a single divination, she could deduce which businesses would turn a profit, which crops would yield a bountiful harvest that year, and the auspicious or inauspicious times to travel.

With such an extraordinary advantage, raking in wealth was guaranteed.

After returning, she maintained herself well as a cultivator. Though she had left home at twelve or thirteen to learn her arts at Shaman God Mountain and only returned in her forties or fifties, she still looked thirty. Thus, she married and gave birth to a son.

Under her guidance, the Wang family transformed from minor landlords into wealthy elites of Yi County in just twenty years, boasting two thousand three hundred and forty-two acres of farmland and an annual income of a hundred gold coins.

And the daughter of the Wang family was now over seventy years old.

Her husband had passed away, but she had dozens of servants. Her son, though a bit slow-witted, was filial and sensible, making the harvests easy to manage.

The blind old woman felt that her life was complete.

She had a fine childhood, free of hardship and without developing a spoiled temperament.

As a young woman, she traveled to Shaman God Mountain and witnessed the true, vast world, escaping the fate of a frog at the bottom of a well.

In her old age, she was wealthy, cared for by her son, and served by retainers, achieving both prosperity and peace.

What more could anyone ask for from such a life?

There was, of course, one more thing.

The world after death.

Her burial ground.

Old Madam Wang, this blind old woman, wanted to select a prime plot of land for her own eternal rest.

This would not only secure ancestral blessings for her descendants but also ensure a peaceful slumber and a favorable reincarnation for herself.

However, it was precisely the selection of this tomb that triggered a disaster.

Old Madam Wang performed her own divinations and observed the qi flows, personally choosing a treasured land of excellent feng shui for her grave.

Afterward, her servants purchased the land. Lord Wang personally oversaw the construction of the tomb, laying the foundation and arranging the furnishings for his mother's life underground.

They brought hoes and picks, preparing to excavate a burial chamber. But with a single strike of the hoe—

They discovered that a tomb was already there.

"Wait, you dug up someone else's grave?" A chill ran down Li Qi's spine.

In a world teeming with ghosts and spirits, digging up another person's tomb was a guaranteed way to invite disaster.

No, the disaster itself was literal proof that ghosts were involved.

Old Madam Wang sighed. "Exactly. That place was an inherent treasure trove of feng shui. I lost my senses for a moment, seeing only its benefits. I failed to consider that such prime locations are always fiercely contested... It already had an owner."

"My son, ignorant of these implications, saw the hollow space inside and entered anyway, disturbing the original owner's peace. The tomb-guarding beast exhaled a mouthful of miasma, corrupting our family's qi veins. Now, even my son does not have long to live," the blind old woman lamented.

As she spoke, she pulled back Lord Wang's robes.

Li Qi clearly saw streaks of death qi wandering through his body, refusing to dissipate.

Astonished, Li Qi blurted out, "Death qi from a tomb-guarding beast? Is the tomb owner still there?!"

"The owner might have been a Rank 8 expert. Though his body is dead, his soul remains, lingering in the tomb. For whatever reason, he was not taken by the yin bailiffs. Now, having lost half his sanity, he is in a muddled state and impossible to communicate with."

"To save my son's life, I willingly entered the tomb and gouged out my own eyes to beg for forgiveness. Yet, it was completely useless. I nearly died inside. My family's qi veins remain severed. If the curse is not lifted, my son will not live past three years." Her voice began to choke with emotion.

"With our qi veins severed, our wealth dried up, and our household fell apart. All the servants were dismissed. Now, only my son and I remain to scrape by. My son has yet to marry and have a child. He cannot die... If he dies, the Wang family line ends with him." Tears flowed from the old woman's cloudy eyes.

"Senior Brother is an Invocator, able to communicate with Human Ghosts. I implore Senior Brother to save my son's life. We still have twenty gold pieces in loose wealth, which I am willing to offer you in full. Moreover, as I promised earlier, I will use my remaining life to corrupt the karmic thread on the dragon colt's Lingering Shadow, ensuring Senior Brother has nothing to worry about in the future." She wiped her tears, her tone returning to its previous steady state.

Following her explanation, Li Qi grasped the general situation.

"I see. In that case, I might be able to give it a try." Li Qi nodded.

If the situation was truly as Old Madam Wang described, her family could not be entirely blamed. After all, they had no idea the treasured land was already occupied.

Since helping them would also resolve his own lingering troubles, why not?

"Do you have paper and a brush?" he asked Lord Wang.

"Hurry and go!" Old Madam Wang gave Lord Wang a shove.

Lord Wang immediately sprinted into the house, rummaging through chests and cabinets. He soon produced a wooden board and a few sticks of charcoal.

"Th-there is no ink or brush left in the house. I found some charcoal," he stuttered.

"That will do." Li Qi nodded, taking the charcoal and swiftly writing a line of words across the board.

A closer look revealed a list of sacrificial items.

"Prepare these items first. I will head back for now and return tomorrow. We will bring them there then," Li Qi said.

"Many thanks, Senior Brother." Old Madam Wang bowed deeply.

"There is no need for that. I will take my leave now," Li Qi said with a sigh.

"Take care, Master Li!" Lord Wang hastily bowed as well.

Li Qi ignored the pleasantries and walked straight out. He first purchased some goods, then exited the city and ventured into the wilderness.

He blew a whistle.

Before long, Shen Shuibi and Old Ma arrived.

"Here, Old Ma. Your beets and oats. Remember not to eat only the oats; mix in some grass and leaves, or you'll get internal heat." Li Qi poured out the oats and tossed a handful of beets over them.

Old Ma let out two soft whinnies and buried his head in the food.

Li Qi then turned to Shen Shuibi.

"Miss Shen, I now have thirty strands of water qi in my body, and they are extremely pure. I wish to apply them to the Carp Stream Intent. What do you think is the best way to do that?" Li Qi humbly asked for her guidance.

The Carp Stream Intent was merely a cultivation method Mount Luofu used to prop up table legs. For Shen Shuibi, it was as simple as a child's arithmetic problem. This should be no trouble for her at all.

Upon hearing this, Shen Shuibi looked a bit puzzled. "Thirty strands of pure water qi? Li Qi, how did you get those?"

Li Qi immediately explained the process of using the gold piece to initiate a sacrifice.

This amused Shen Shuibi greatly, and she repeatedly praised his cleverness.

However, after the praise, she began to seriously consider the best approach.

Li Qi's understanding of cultivation fell far short of hers, so he simply waited by her side as she pondered.

After thinking for a while, she suddenly looked up. "Li Qi, I've thought of a way. Do you want to reach Rank 9 of the Martial Dao?"

Li Qi shuddered in surprise.

_Entering the ranks!?_
