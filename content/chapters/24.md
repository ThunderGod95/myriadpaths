# Chapter 24: Demon

As for Li Qi, seeing the girl finally awake brought a smile to his face. He opened his mouth, revealing a set of pearly white teeth.

Why?

Because now that she was awake, there would be far less trouble.

Furthermore, this woman looked wealthy at a glance; her clothes were made of silk gauze.

You have to be kidding—Li Qi had never even touched silk gauze before. Even the wealthy households and middle-class families he could come into contact with in Li Prefecture City mostly wore cotton. As for a wretched pauper like him, having hemp cloth to wear was already decent enough.

What sort of concept was silk gauze?

At the very least, she had to be from a major landowning family, right?

There was just one problem...

If she really had money, hiring capable people shouldn't be an issue, so why drag it out until now, leaving her to be rescued by passersby like them?

It didn't make sense.

But it was also possible that it was just a coincidence.

However... there might be other reasons. One could never be too guarded against others, so he decided to test the waters.

Li Qi mulled over these thoughts: "Miss..."

"Awooh—ugh!" Shen Shuibi shuddered in fright, making a strange noise in her throat and even rolling away.

Ba Kui took one look and frowned. "This woman, she was probably traumatized by the demon and has gone mad. This is going to be trouble."

"No trouble, no trouble. It's better if she's mad; we don't have to take responsibility. Once we've had a taste, we can just dump her anywhere and she'll run off on her own. We won't even have to get our hands dirty," a traveling merchant nearby said.

Li Qi now understood exactly what kind of people these merchants were. No wonder Ah Du didn't dare travel with them and preferred finding strangers.

These people were likely merchants in normal times, but once an opportunity arose, they would immediately transform into bandits. They didn't mind committing evil at all. Perhaps they had some sense of loyalty, but like Li Kui from the stories, it was a limited loyalty to their own, devoid of any concept of right and wrong.[^1]

As for the greater righteousness that encompasses the world, Li Qi felt that a wretched tracker like himself had no qualification to discuss it.

But before he could speak, Shen Shuibi heard them and immediately scrambled up.

"I... I'm not crazy! You all, don't... don't..." She stammered for a long while before finally getting it out, "Don't touch me!"

Compared to her stuttering, her movement to stand up was extremely agile. She didn't look like someone who had been jolted around all night.

It was because that man named Li Qi was smiling so terrifically, baring his teeth as if he wanted to eat people.

No, eat rabbits.

As for Li Qi, he felt somewhat baffled.

This time he didn't pause, but spoke all at once, "Miss, what is your name?"

Although he didn't know what this woman had misunderstood, she didn't seem very bright, so it was best to guide her first.

"I... my name is Shen Shuibi."

"My name is Li Qi. Miss Shen, were you captured by that demon earlier? Do you remember where your home is?" Li Qi asked again.

"My home is in Jiannan..." Shen Shuibi replied subconsciously, then she suddenly realized and hurriedly covered her mouth.

"Jiannan?" Li Qi was stunned. He hadn't heard of this place name. Was there a place called Jiannan near Li Prefecture?

He looked around at the traveling merchants. These people wandered everywhere buying and selling produce; they should know more place names.

But the merchants also seemed bewildered, having never heard of it.

Ah Du, however, thought for a moment and suddenly said, "I once followed a large merchant caravan. Listening to their idle chat, I learned that the Tang Empire has a place named Jiannan Dao. Could it be there?"

"The Tang Empire?" Li Qi frowned. "Miss Shen, you come from the Tang Empire?"

"No, no! It must just be a shared name! The... the Jiannan I'm talking about is a small place, very small. It's normal that you haven't heard of it!" Shen Shuibi said in a panic.

"Then, Miss Shen, did you have any relationship with the demon from before?"

"No, no relationship!" Shen Shuibi answered immediately!

At this, the traveling merchants all took a step back and pulled out their hatchets.

Ah Du also hid behind them.

Shen Shuibi immediately realized she had said the wrong thing.

Her tears were about to fall.

When she was by her Ladyship's side, she never told lies!

Now she not only had to lie, but she stammered through it, her clumsiness obvious at a single glance.

Li Qi, however, didn't turn around. Instead, he put his hand behind his back and quietly waved, signaling the others to leave quickly.

Then, acting as if he hadn't noticed the commotion behind him at all, he walked up.

"Is that so? It's good that there's no relationship, you scared me to death." Li Qi scratched his head, revealing a kind smile.

"Eh..." Shen Shuibi looked confused.

This person... was he fooled?

"It's just, I'm sorry, Miss. We are all laborers with no skills. We can't escort you back to Jiannan, we don't know the terrain, and we lack the ability. How about we part ways here?" Li Qi said politely.

Hearing this, Shen Shuibi felt a burst of joy in her heart, forgetting everything else as she nodded hurriedly.

"Then it's settled. We'll be going first. I'm afraid you will have to make your own way home, Miss," Li Qi said with a pleasant expression.

"It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter! I can go back by myself!" Shen Shuibi said quickly.

"Then we will part ways here. We haven't eaten the rice cakes in the pot yet. We usually scoop them into bowls to share. Miss, you can eat first to satisfy your hunger," Li Qi added.

"Thank you!" Shen Shuibi bowed her head repeatedly in thanks, having already forgotten what exactly had scared her into standing up.

Having finished speaking, Li Qi turned around and gave the group a significant look.

The merchants immediately tucked away their hatchets, shouldered their baskets, abandoned the pot, and ran!

Li Qi followed without hesitation, dragging Ah Du along in a mad dash!

Are you kidding?! The thing behind them was most likely a demon!

And one that looked no different from a human—probably a demon capable of taking human form. That wild dog demon definitely had something to do with her!

Although he didn't know what the other party was thinking, while the demon's brain wasn't working well, if they didn't run now, were they looking to die?

While Li Qi had stabilized the demon, the group sprinted once again. They had no mind for idle chatter on the road, traveling in a rush. From first light in the morning, drinking only water along the way and having no time to eat, they finally rushed to Feng County by dusk.

Having finally arrived at Feng County, everyone could catch their breath.

Even Ba Kui gave a thumbs up at this moment. Although he was so tired he was gasping for air, he still praised, "Hoo... huff, Brother Li Qi, I really hand it to you! Facing a demon, you were actually able to stay so calm!"

"I didn't expect it either... huff, ha... haha." Li Qi was also panting ceaselessly. "I didn't expect that demon to be so easy to talk to, as if she were a fool... I was ready to fight her to the death if she couldn't keep up the act of being innocent! I didn't think she would actually keep pretending, which allowed us to escape!"

"It was Big Brother Li who kept his cool. He knew the demon was pretending to be a good person and didn't startle the snake in the grass, letting us run away. If we had been exposed, who knows, we might have had to fight another battle." Ah Du also hurriedly spoke up.
