# Chapter 60: Half a Month Later

In the dark of night.

Amidst the jungle.

The moon was hidden and the wind blew fierce, making it a perfect night for murder and arson.

Goats were not a common sight in these mountain woods.

They usually roamed further down near the base of the mountains, surviving along the rocky cliffs.

But perhaps this one had wandered off, for a lone goat halfway up the mountain was highly conspicuous.

Li Qi had already half-risen from his crouch, drawing his wood-chopping knife with his right hand and taking aim at the goat's neck.

At this moment, he was a full thirty meters away.

However, that was enough.

He needed only a single second for the blade to pierce the artery in the beast's neck, so he was simply waiting for the perfect opportunity.

The goat lowered its head, gnawing at the withered grass beneath its hooves.

Li Qi raised his hand with blinding speed, his entire body launching forward like an arrow released from a bowstring.

The blade sliced straight through the goat's neck, yet the creature did not collapse instantly as he had anticipated.

In this world, even a solitary goat was not something easily dealt with.

The beast let out a mournful bleat and, fueled by a final surge of dying adrenaline, began leaping forward at a frantic pace.

Mountain goats were inherently skilled at scaling cliffs, capable of leaping five zhang in a single bound. Ordinary people could never hope to catch one bouncing along through their own abilities alone.

In an instant, this goat with half its neck severed left Li Qi far behind in the dust.

"Damn it!" Li Qi sheathed his wood-chopping knife and sprinted after the fleeing animal, the wind whipping past his legs. Although the goat was doomed to die, it could very well run for four or five li before collapsing, and he dared not pursue it that far at this hour, for running into a ferocious beast would cost him his life.

The mountains held more than just goats; there were wolves, tigers, and leopards as well.

When traveling along the main roads, there were usually villages nearby, keeping the various predators at bay.

This was because these main roads were not intentionally paved highways, but rather the mountain passes and trails frequently trodden by travelers moving between different settlements and towns.

There were originally no paths in the mountains, but as more people walked them, trails naturally formed. These safe and smooth routes had been scouted out by generations of villagers, and any nearby beasts or other hazards had long since been eradicated to ensure safe passage for locals and traveling merchants.

Even the wild animals had learned their lesson and would not easily approach these areas, knowing they belonged to humanity. Over the years, countless people had come and gone, and while a beast might occasionally succeed in snatching a meal, it would undoubtedly be hunted down and exterminated afterward.

Therefore, barring any unforeseen accidents, these roads were free of danger, or at least they were safe enough for Li Qi.

But if this goat veered off the path and dashed a few miles into the depths of the wilderness, things would be entirely different.

Within the ancient, deep forests, there were not only ferocious beasts but also the potential for demons.

Still, Li Qi was reluctant to give up on the prey right in front of him. A whole goat could provide a hearty meal—no, more than one, it would feed him for three days, and its horns and pelt could fetch a handsome price.

He swiftly trailed behind the beast, but it was simply too fast, and the distance between them steadily grew.

Left with no other choice, he silently weighed the pros and cons in his mind and decided to abandon the chase. Pursuing it any further would be far too perilous and simply not worth the risk.

"Sigh, my blade skills are still too sloppy." Li Qi stopped in his tracks and shook his head.

His technique was incredibly rusty. Even with the wood-chopping knife and the explosive power of the Carp Stream Intent, he had actually failed to cleanly sever a goat's head.

However, abandoning the chase did not mean giving up on the goat.

He blew a forceful whistle.

The sharp whistling pierced the night sky, letting out an ear-splitting shriek!

Soon after, an incredibly imposing neigh echoed in response!

A horse neighed into the darkness, its long cry resounding through the forest!

Just then, a magnificent steed blurred across the mountain terrain, moving leagues faster than the fleeing goat!

Cloud qi bloomed beneath its hooves, and with the wind roaring in its wake, it galloped through the woods at a terrifying speed!

The goat could leap five zhang and scale sheer vertical cliffs as if walking on flat ground.

But this horse could fly!

Accompanied by the cloud qi beneath its hooves, the steed leaped a staggering fifteen zhang, crossing nearly fifty meters in a single bound!

From a distance, it looked virtually indistinguishable from true flight.

In a few short strides, the steed caught up to the goat, leaping up to trample the creature into the dirt before rearing its hooves and delivering a powerful kick that sent the goat flying into the cliff wall, killing it instantly.

The goat finally lay motionless. With its windpipe severed by the wood-chopping knife, its frantic sprint had caused massive bloody bubbles to froth at its mouth, and after enduring those kicks, it lacked any remaining strength to run, breathing its last breath shortly after.

The horse landed lightly, happily clopping its hooves and neighing toward Li Qi in the distance.

"I'm coming, Old Ma!" Li Qi shouted loudly, using both hands and feet to scramble through the forest at a pace that, while inferior to the animals, was certainly not slow.

He soon arrived beside Old Ma, hoisted the goat onto his shoulders, swung himself onto the saddle, and patted the horse's neck. "Let's go, we're heading back to Miss Shen."

Old Ma offered two affectionate snorts and broke into a run.

Even within the dense mountain woods, this dragon colt ran with blinding speed and effortless grace.

During a full sprint, he could cover thirty zhang in a second, translating to over ninety meters per second or nearly three hundred and twenty kilometers per hour; if he had wings, he could have taken to the skies.

Even without sprinting, carrying a person at a leisurely pace to conserve stamina, traveling eight hundred li in a single day was a breeze.

Indeed, Old Ma's injuries were fully healed.

At this point, a full seventeen days had passed since Li Qi had been grievously wounded.

Over these seventeen days, Li Qi had trained bitterly day and night, completely disregarding fatigue and muscle strain. Whenever his body gave out, he would endlessly channel the Great Forest Wood qi to mend all his injuries before immediately resuming his grueling regimen.

Through this fortnight of effort, aided by abundant water sources and water qi, he had successfully grasped the basics of the Carp Stream Intent. Although he remained unranked, he was vastly stronger than his former self.

At the very least, he no longer relied solely on brute strength in a fight. He now possessed a martial art, with a dozen strands of inner qi circulating through his meridians, granting him an explosive force of five thousand catties at a moment's notice.

This was five thousand catties backed by technique, an entirely different concept from the pure brawn of the Ox Strength Art. In a direct clash between two fighters, martial skill played a monumental role.

He had even tested it specifically on boulders; by activating the Ox Strength Art in tandem with the Carp Stream Intent, he could effortlessly heft a twenty-thousand-catty boulder and hurl it away.

According to Shen Shuibi, even though his proficiency in both the Shaman Dao and the Martial Dao remained unranked, the two paths complemented each other perfectly. Additionally, Li Qi possessed a high-quality military-grade long saber steeped in baleful qi and military qi.

By utilizing all these advantages and triggering the Ox Strength Art, he was fully capable of going toe-to-toe with an ordinary Rank Nine rogue cultivator without losing ground.

In other words, he was now qualified to work as an escort or a compound guard—professions that relied on martial prowess to make a living.

During this period, his food rations had run dry, leaving hunting as his only means of acquiring a meal.

It was then that Li Qi discovered he could successfully hunt using his martial arts.

Mountain goats and red foxes that he previously couldn't even touch were now prey he could ambush, inflicting heavy injuries or killing them in a single strike!

This realization left Li Qi swelling with immense pride.

He could finally be considered a capable person in his own right!
