# Chapter 86: Sly

The voice had barely arrived when Li Qi felt a burst of sharp intent almost simultaneously.

Without a moment's hesitation, internal qi surged within Li Qi's body. His frame reacted in a fraction of a second, instantly raising his military saber. Although it had not yet been drawn, he still used the scabbard to block a strike.

With a tearing sound, the hemp cloth wrapping the long blade shattered into fragments, completely exposing the saber.

But whatever the scabbard was made of, it managed to forcefully block the blow, deflecting the sharp intent that had pierced through the air.

_The sound and the hidden weapon arrived at almost the exact same time... Does this thing move at the speed of sound?_ Li Qi's heart skipped a beat. After blocking the attack, he focused his gaze and found that it was a flying needle.

No, it was not a flying needle.

It was... a single hair?

A hair made of metal? No, it was still drifting in the air. It was soft, clearly not made of metal.

It floated lightly, like the fur of some animal. It was incredibly fine and soft, tumbling through the air at the slightest breeze, even bending visibly under the strong wind.

Yet, Li Qi glanced at the scabbard of his long saber.

There was a highly conspicuous mark on it, as if it had been forcefully cleaved by an axe. A fissure the length of a finger had appeared on the scabbard.

This military saber's scabbard was made of ironwood.

_Metal qi?_ Li Qi activated his qi perspective and gazed into the distance.

He realized that there was nothing profound about the hair itself. However, that previous strike had been imbued with a wisp of metal qi. That was why it could ring out with the clash of steel, pierce the vast sky, and fly at near-sonic speeds to effortlessly shatter refined ironwood—all while using an unknown animal's hair as its vessel.

Metal qi embodies the aspect of weapons. It is piercingly cold, violating all other things. Grass withers when brushed by it, and trees shed their leaves when struck by it. The reason it can destroy and wither is due to the lingering ferocity.

This person was highly skilled at utilizing metal qi. He wondered which Daoist Tradition this cultivator belonged to.

Li Qi's gaze pierced through the distance. On a painted pleasure boat drifting upon the nearby Li River, a person was meeting his eyes.

Was he the one who had spoken just a moment ago?

And was this single hair his attack?

No. If it were truly an attack, it wouldn't have been just that.

Perhaps this counted as... a warning?

Although this warning was not particularly friendly.

Just as Li Qi was observing vigilantly, that voice rang out again.

"Haha, little brother, why be so aggressive? He's just an errand boy, is there any need to go this far?"

Accompanying the voice was a bald, fat man drifting gracefully through the air.

The man was extremely fat, bald, and sported a beard. He wore a loose, voluminous robe. The man looked like a seal draped in kelp and seaweed, swimming right out of the water.

Only, he was flying over.

He fluttered down from the sky. If he had been a handsome young master, he would have undoubtedly attracted countless gazes.

But unfortunately, he was a bald fat man.

Li Qi glanced around and noticed no reaction from his surroundings, as if no one else had heard the fat man's voice.

However, the trackers behind him and Sixth Uncle saw the fat man flying over. They stared in dumbfounded shock, as if they were witnessing an immortal deity.

"Sixth Uncle, step back. Get out of the way." Li Qi spoke in a low voice, waving his hand to usher the bystanders away. He stepped forward, gripping his long saber tightly, his expression solemn.

"Your Excellency sent someone to cause trouble, then launched a sneak attack on me, and now you advise me not to be aggressive. I'm afraid that's a bit unreasonable, isn't it?" Li Qi wore a smile. One hand rested on his saber, ready to draw at a moment's notice, while his other hand remained behind his back, prepared to grasp his willow branch at any second.

This could be considered his combat stance.

At the same time, he began monitoring the progress bar of that bald fat man.

If the opponent made a move, it would inevitably be indicated by the progress bar, ensuring he wouldn't fall victim to another sneak attack.

"Haha, my fault, my fault. I offer my apologies to you, little brother. Blame it on your profound skill in hiding your qi. Your older brother here had no idea you were here. Otherwise, I certainly wouldn't have come to bother you!" The bald fat man laughed heartily. He was incredibly enthusiastic, showing not a hint of hostility.

Li Qi furrowed his brows.

He knew the other party had no intention of making an enemy of him, but how did he know there was a 'happy occasion' happening here?

So he also changed his tune, "May I ask how to address you, older brother? What brings you here?"

"Hey, you're already calling me older brother, no need to be so distant. The wind is strong standing out here, it's not a place to talk. Why not join me on the boat for a chat?" The bald fat man waved his hand, acting completely familiar.

Li Qi immediately showed a troubled expression, cupping his hands in silence.

"Ouch, look at my brain! Little brother was just so tense, of course that won't do! Then, you pick a place, and your older brother will treat you tonight!" the bald fat man declared.

Li Qi glanced back at Sixth Uncle and the trackers.

"Older brother has come from afar, why don't I play the host? You can stay here and have some meager wine, how about that?" Li Qi suggested.

"That works, that works!" Who would have thought that this fat seal of man wouldn't hesitate at all and directly agreed.

Then, he clapped his hands.

Suddenly, dozens of martial artists flew out from the painted pleasure boat.

Li Qi could tell that none of these people were ranked, but they were definitely much stronger than the trackers. Their level was roughly equivalent to his own when he previously used the Ox Strength Art.

None of them were weaklings.

To think they could achieve such a level—dozens of men, each possessing the strength of an ox!

Was it an organization?

A sect?

If these dozens of people attacked at once... what should he do?

Li Qi's heart tightened. As he watched them fly over, he readied himself for a bloody fight. His internal qi was already elevated, and his Ox Strength Art was in a state ready to be activated at any moment.

However, after those dozens of people landed, they didn't make a move. 

Instead, they all bowed in greeting: "Elder Bao!"

Li Qi looked at the bald seal. So he was this Elder Bao?

"Go fetch some tables, chairs, and food. Have the boat prepare some signature dishes. I'm going to have a meal with my little brother here!" Elder Bao was not polite at all, waving his hand to issue the orders.

Surprisingly, the disciples were extremely obedient. They flew back up, skimming across the surface of the Li River like dragonflies, and returned to the painted boat. Some carried tables, others carried dishes. In just a few minutes, they managed to set up a full banquet, and it was even steaming hot! Completely freshly made!

"Alright, your business is done here. Go back and eat and drink on your own," Elder Bao said casually.

After bowing, the disciples returned once more, seemingly harboring no resentment at being ordered around like servants.

Li Qi watched the entire process.

So this... was a cultivation sect?

"Come, come, come, little brother! Let's sit and eat first! Older brother was in the wrong earlier, I'll punish myself with three cups!" Elder Bao sat down, gulped down three cups of wine in rapid succession, and invited Li Qi to drink with him.

Li Qi didn't want to clash with the other party. After all, if it were just him alone, it would be manageable, but now... there were dozens of disciples. He wasn't afraid, but the people of the Wave-Rowing Gang were.

Therefore, he also sat down, cupped his hands, and then picked up his chopsticks.

From start to finish, no one paid any attention to Vegetable Head Zhang, who was still strung up.
