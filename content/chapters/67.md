# Chapter 67: Old Woman

Li Qi was in an excellent mood.

Now, even if there was a curse on that piece of gold, it absolutely wouldn't affect him.

If the curse had a problem with it, it could go take it up with the God of the Li River. After witnessing the magnificent Azure Splendor Palace, Li Qi was brimming with confidence in a behemoth that held sway over an entire kingdom.

At the same time, he felt a deep sense of awe.

The sight of that self-contained grotto-heaven, with its palaces and waterways extending in all directions, had left Li Qi profoundly shaken.

He had read the [Book of Invocation] before, and its geographical descriptions always made him feel that the Great Deer Kingdom was a petty nation, hardly worth mentioning. He could ride out of its borders in half a month.

Yet, a river god enshrined by such a tiny, insignificant nation possessed a magnificent grotto-heaven, immense power, and such spectacular scenery.

Within the domains of Shaman God Mountain, there were at least a thousand nations like the Great Deer Kingdom.

As for those larger than the Great Deer Kingdom, there was no telling how many there were.

The God of the Li River wasn't even qualified to be recorded in the [Classic of Waterways], nor was the Li River considered one of the famous rivers under heaven.

Li Qi felt as though he were an ant at the foot of a mountain; even a rock on the road looked like a towering peak to him.

Yet, he couldn't see the true high mountain, because even if he craned his neck, the peak remained hidden.

_I do not know the true face of the mountain, simply because I am standing amidst this mountain._

Then, what must Mount Luofu look like?

Just how spectacular must Shaman God Mountain be?

At the thought of these things, the thirty wisps of pure water qi swirling within his body suddenly seemed like nothing at all.

The burden was heavy and the road was long.

However, Li Qi grew increasingly excited.

It was just like that time in the beginning, when he first saw the Human Dao's qi emanating from the two hundred thousand people of Feng County.

Just two hundred thousand people had already been so shocking.

It made Li Qi yearn to stand at the peak of the mountain and survey the myriad Daos in a single glance.

Just how majestic would that view be?

Lost in thought, Li Qi swam out of the river and waved his hand to dismiss the temporary laborers.

He then packed up the remaining usable items, like the fish-skin drum, bundled them tightly, and prepared to leave.

It was already afternoon; he would buy some more food and then head out of the city.

Staying overnight in the city was too expensive. Besides, he was already used to sleeping in the wilderness, and it was quite peaceful.

As for this water qi...

He would ask Shen Shuibi first, since she was highly knowledgeable, to see if there was a good way to utilize it.

With everything packed, Li Qi was ready to hit the market for dry rations, along with the beets and oats he had promised Old Ma.

However, before he had taken two steps, he spotted the wealthy man he had met earlier, his head covered in sweat.

Upon seeing him, Li Qi decisively turned and walked the other way.

He would take a detour before going to the market.

But the man clearly had no intention of letting him go.

The plump, wealthy man rushed up and grabbed Li Qi's arm. "Hey! Little brother! Little brother! Do you remember me? I bought your beast bones this morning!"

Li Qi frowned and turned around. "Sir, we traded money for goods. I didn't shortchange you, and you didn't underpay. What are you doing holding onto me right now?"

"Oh dear, oh dear, little brother—ah, no, Great Shaman, I had eyes but failed to recognize Mount Tai, and I offended you! Please, forgive my transgressions!" The merchant gripped Li Qi's sleeve tightly, refusing to let go while fawning incessantly.

But he was only an ordinary person; Li Qi channeled the Carp Stream Intent, making his body as slippery as a loach, and easily tore free.

This move stunned the man, who hastily chased after him, tackling Li Qi's legs and kneeling on the ground. "Great Shaman, please save me!"

"Your eminence is magnanimous and won't remember the faults of a lowly person; please save my life! I am willing to offer ten pieces of gold... ah, no, twenty pieces of gold!"

His sudden, dramatic plea caused countless people on the street to stop and stare.

Li Qi despised being the center of attention. He immediately yanked the man to his feet, lowering his voice with a hint of anger. "If you have something to say, then say it! Don't think you can hold me here by force. If I turn and walk away, let's see who will save you then!"

The wealthy man quickly rose, wiping his tears, though he continued to sob as if truly heartbroken.

Li Qi watched with annoyance. This person had plotted against him earlier, yet now came crying to play the victim. It was highly displeasing, and Li Qi's first instinct was to walk away.

But he had said twenty pieces of gold.

That was a lot.

He hadn't seen this much money in his entire life.

Converted into coins, it was two hundred thousand coins.

It was enough for him to hold a grand ritual for over a hundred people.

Therefore, Li Qi didn't leave. Furrowing his brows and suppressing his annoyance, he walked quickly forward. "Let's go. We'll talk at your house."

Seeing this, the man stood up in pleasant surprise and followed Li Qi, quickly dodging the crowd's line of sight and returning to his family's mansion.

It was still just as eerie.

The man hastily opened the door and invited Li Qi inside.

"Great Shaman, listen to me..." The man began, eager to explain.

Li Qi quickly interrupted him. "I'm not a Great Shaman. My surname is Li, and I'm just an ordinary wandering Spell Master."

He was unwilling to state that he was a proper Shaman Invocator. After all, it seemed that the Great Deer Kingdom had been completely assimilated by the customs of the Tang Empire, and although some of its original Shaman Dao customs still remained, its institutions leaned heavily toward the Tang Empire's ways.

In times like these, the identity of a wandering Spell Master was much safer than that of a Shaman.

Ordinary Shamans might not be regulated by anyone, but he was from Shaman God Mountain, so it was better to be careful.

There was no telling how many people named Li Qi there were in the Great Deer Kingdom.

But Invocators from Shaman God Mountain? There were definitely very few.

"Then... then I'll call you Master Li. Master Li, you definitely came to save me, right? You saw the problem with that gold?" The man offered a hasty, fawning smile.

"Stop right there. Don't be so eager to get close. From the sound of it, you knew there was a problem with that gold, didn't you? Knowing it was cursed and still tossing it to me... I'm afraid that wasn't very kind of you." Unmoved by the man's flattery, Li Qi stepped back, pulling a long, stiff face.

"Sigh, wasn't I forced into it with no other choice? I didn't know you were a master, ah." The merchant scratched his head, his expression remaining obsequious.

"And if I were an ordinary person, wouldn't you have killed me?" Hearing this, Li Qi was genuinely annoyed.

For this man to admit it so brazenly meant he had serious character flaws.

He lacked both a conscience and a brain.

Li Qi understood a deep principle: you could work with the unscrupulous because they were driven by mutual interest, and you could work with the foolish because they could be swayed by sincerity.

In both cases, their behavior remained predictable.

But predicting the actions of someone lacking both brains and a conscience? That was impossible.

Therefore, he didn't even want the twenty pieces of gold anymore.

Because unexpected complications would definitely arise.

This wealthy merchant could go to hell; Li Qi would be better off hitting the road immediately.

But at this moment, an aged voice rang out behind Li Qi.

"My son is a bit foolish. I apologize, Honored Invocator. This old woman's eyes were clumsy before; I failed to recognize your arrival, Senior Brother."
