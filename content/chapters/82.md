# Chapter 82: Gang

"Sixth Uncle!" Li Qi stood up to greet Sixth Uncle, his face brimming with a wide smile.

Sixth Uncle, however, could not bring himself to smile. He walked right up and punched Li Qi in the shoulder, looking furious. "You little rascal! I told you not to come back for at least half a year! It hasn't even been a month! What are you doing back here? Are you upset that no one is making trouble for you? Even if the officials aren't looking for you, do you think the Strong Force Gang has all died off!?"

Li Qi took the punch with a smile. Then, he gently raised his hand, and internal qi surged forth.

Sixth Uncle suddenly felt his body become incredibly light. He was instantly tossed into the air, the entire world flipping upside down.

Then, he slowly descended to the ground without the slightest jolt.

This single move stunned both the surrounding trackers and Sixth Uncle.

A dead silence fell over the area. The previously lively atmosphere cooled significantly.

Then, an earth-shattering cheer erupted!

"Brother Li, did you successfully cultivate a spell art!?"

"Our gang has produced an expert!? Are we going to rise to the top!?"

"Woohoo!"

The trackers let out boiling cheers of pure joy, every single one of them beaming with delight.

Seeing this, Li Qi smiled and pulled out a gold cake.

It weighed roughly one tael of gold.

He slapped the gold cake onto the table. "Everyone, go buy some meat and wine today! Tonight, when the other brothers return, we are going to have a feast!"

Another, even louder round of cheering followed.

"Alright, Sixth Uncle, let's talk in the room." Ignoring the ecstatic trackers, Li Qi pulled the hunched older man along, and the two of them stepped away from the crowd.

Sixth Uncle stared at Li Qi, his eyes filled with speechless astonishment. However, knowing what was important, he followed Li Qi into the room.

As soon as Sixth Uncle entered—even though it was just a dilapidated little wooden shack with thin plank walls—he carefully closed and locked the door.

Then, lowering his voice, he glared sternly at Li Qi. "What is going on! You've only been gone for half a month. Where did you get so much money?! And what is with these skills?!"

"You are still young. Do not let greed bring disaster upon you!"

His first concern wasn't the gold cake Li Qi had produced, but rather an anxious desire to ensure the young man's safety.

To this old tracker who had toiled his entire life, one gold—equivalent to ten thousand copper coins—was simply too much. It was an amount that made him deeply uneasy.

He would rather forgo the money to guarantee Li Qi remained safe and sound.

Li Qi smiled at his reaction.

It reminded him of two or three years ago, when he had trekked through the forest for two days before collapsing headfirst into the Li River. He had washed downstream like a corpse, only to be pulled from the water by Sixth Uncle.

The Wave-Rowing Gang was his first home after arriving in this world, and these brothers truly treated him as one of their own.

In this world, even blood brothers might not be trustworthy.

But gang brothers were people who truly tied their lives and fortunes together. They were comrades to whom one could entrust their back, good brothers who shared the same interests and deep emotional bonds.

In the very beginning, when Li Qi knew nothing, he had caused them no end of trouble and had to rely on the charity of these already impoverished trackers.

Therefore, Li Qi also harbored profound affection for the Wave-Rowing Gang.

"Don't worry, Sixth Uncle. Just listen to me first," Li Qi said, comforting him before recounting his experiences over the past month.

He concealed certain matters, such as Lady Luofu, the war between Shaman God Mountain and the Tang Empire, and the soldiers of the Song Kingdom. He only mentioned that he had embarked on the path of cultivation, encountered demons along the way, and been tricked by an old woman.

Yet, even this brief account left Sixth Uncle trembling with fear, repeatedly asking if Li Qi was alright.

After finishing his story, Li Qi pulled out five more gold cakes—amounting to five gold—and placed them into Sixth Uncle's palm.

"I am a cultivator now, so making money has become much easier. Don't worry, I can handle this wealth!" Li Qi said with absolute confidence.

Sixth Uncle stared at Li Qi.

This little brat really did seem different now.

"I don't know what a cultivator is, but earning a lot means you must also spend a lot. I'll just take two." Sixth Uncle weighed the gold cakes in his hand, separated three, and returned them to Li Qi. "We don't need to spend much. In the future, you will definitely need to buy treasured panaceas and divine weapons. You should keep these for yourself. Spend the money you earned on your own needs."

"Sixth Uncle, what is there to argue about? Do you think I won't be able to earn more in the future? Besides, I already saved some for myself." Li Qi pushed the gold back, feigning a nonchalant attitude.

He knew that giving too much money wasn't a good thing, which was why he only took out six gold. One gold would cover tonight's food, which was just about enough to buy a meal for hundreds of people.

The remaining five gold were best kept hidden by the mature and prudent Sixth Uncle.

"Right now, I am someone who can stand on equal footing with those constables!" Li Qi declared, raising his head.

These words made Sixth Uncle freeze.

Shortly after, the hunched old tracker accepted the money.

It was true. Li Qi was someone comparable to constables; he was already a big shot.

Over the decades, Sixth Uncle was acutely aware of just how lucrative a constable's position could be.

Which stall head or gang didn't offer them a little tribute?

A few hundred or a few thousand coins from each establishment. Not to mention the entire city, just in this single district alone with so many gangs, it added up to over a hundred gold a year.

This boy Li... how did he become so successful after just one trip away?

Before Sixth Uncle could make sense of it all, Li Qi continued, "Also, stop practicing the spell art I taught you all last time. I learned from an expert that the spell art is flawed. Practicing it is fine, but if you try to use it without a catalyst, it could cost you your life."

Sixth Uncle's train of thought was interrupted. Startled by this revelation, he was about to speak, but seeing that Li Qi had more to say, he quickly shut his mouth and listened.

"But don't worry. It's only been half a month, so none of you should have mastered it yet. There's no need to panic; just don't practice it from now on," Li Qi added.

"But... if we don't practice this, how will we establish our foothold?" Sixth Uncle asked.

"Don't worry. I found another cultivation method for you all. It is an upgraded version of the Wave-Shattering Force, called Carp Stream Intent!" Li Qi said.

"Is Carp Stream Intent the cultivation method you are practicing now?" Sixth Uncle asked curiously.

"I have practiced it, but it isn't my main focus. As for my primary cultivation method, I cannot teach it to you. You should understand why, Sixth Uncle."

"I understand, I understand." Sixth Uncle naturally knew the severe implications of sharing cultivation methods, so he didn't press the matter.

However, he immediately realized something else.

Li Qi no longer belonged to the Wave-Rowing Gang.

He was practicing a new cultivation method, which meant he belonged to a new faction.

But that was perfectly normal. People always strove for higher ground...

Yes, that was how it should be.

"Don't worry, I won't forget this place. Look, didn't I think of you all and come right back?" Li Qi said with a smile, noticing Sixth Uncle's expression.

With that, he pulled out a scroll of linen. Written upon it were the cultivation instructions for the Carp Stream Intent that he had transcribed during his journey.

However, while the two were still talking, an explosive crash suddenly rang out from outside!
