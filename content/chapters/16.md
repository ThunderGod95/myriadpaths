# Chapter 16: Partnering Up

Ah Du noticed the change in Li Qi's expression, so he immediately delved deeper into the topic. "This is also what we usually refer to as 'Jing-Qi-Shen' (Essence-Qi-Spirit). However, Qi is not air; calling it 'air' is purely a misunderstanding."

As he spoke, he dipped his finger in the tea and wrote two homophonous characters on the table to show the distinction.

"Essence refers to the power of the physical body. The body's qi and blood, muscles, bones, and internal organs—combined together, they are vital energy. Usually, when we do manual labor, we consume vital energy. When vital energy is vigorous, the body possesses a fiery qi, and ordinary little ghosts cannot get close. Big Brother Li, you are full of vital energy; one look and I know you are full of fire. Even if you walked in a graveyard, ghosts wouldn't seek you out," he said with a smile.

"Spirit refers to the vitality of our thoughts. When we think and are awake, we are using mental energy. Sometimes, even though we lie on a bed and haven't done a bit of heavy lifting, thinking for a whole day makes us feel exhausted. This is because although the vital energy remains, the mental energy has been completely worn down. When mental energy is sufficient, one is quick-witted and incomparably intelligent," Ah Du explained.

"Then Brother Ah Du, you must be the type with sufficient mental energy, right?" Li Qi said with a smile.

"Hehe, I can't say that, I can't say that." Ah Du scratched his head, laughing simple-mindedly for a moment, then twisted the topic back to the main point. "As for the final Qi, it is the most important one."

"Essence and Spirit are indispensable things for the operation of the human body. Without Essence and Spirit, a person becomes weak. We usually say someone has 'no spirit' (no energy); actually, this is a profound truth in simple words. These most basic things were spread to the world by the Sages long ago," Ah Du said to Li Qi with emotion.

Li Qi felt deeply sympathetic to this.

The most basic axioms were always the most widely circulated, yet the more basic they were, the more unshakable they became, because all higher existences were built upon them.

As everyone knows, the cutting-edge technology in top journals is overthrown and rebuilt every year, and ordinary people can't be bothered to understand it.

But if a law in an elementary school textbook is altered, it represents a massive shaking of the entire edifice of science.

This world, presumably, was the same.

"But Essence and Spirit do not exist independently; they are harmonized by Qi in the center. Qi is formless and without substance, yet it is the foundation of Essence and Spirit. Yang qi is a type of energy transformed from Qi. All life activities depend on Qi; it is the origin of nature and life."

"The relationship between the three is intimate; they nourish each other, rely on one another as a single body, and together constitute a human. And this is the key point I want to discuss next. Big Brother Li, the Pre-Heaven Three Treasures can be weakened or activated through certain methods. Once activated, they have a restraining effect on demons and ghostly things. If we want to pass through the wilderness, we have to learn these methods," Ah Du said.

"You want to teach me?" Li Qi was startled.

This person not only told him what the Pre-Heaven Three Treasures were for free, but was also willing to tell him how to activate them?

Although this couldn't be called a cultivation method, such a little trick wasn't something one would casually tell a stranger, right?

Li Qi raised his vigilance internally.

One who is unaccountably solicitous is hiding either evil intentions or thievery. This person might be looking for someone to trigger a trap for him.

"I wouldn't call it teaching, just wanting a bit more insurance. Big Brother Li, I really have very important business on my side, important enough that I must go out even if alone. We both know how dangerous it is to travel far alone." Ah Du scratched his head with a bitter smile. "So, I am really afraid of something happening. It doesn't matter if something happens to me, but if the business I'm carrying is delayed, that would truly be a major problem. I would regret it for a lifetime."

"Therefore, I will definitely do anything that can increase my chances of success, just like how I suddenly came to disturb you," Ah Du said with a frank expression.

"Then why don't you join them?" Li Qi quietly pointed a finger at a surrounding merchant group.

There were two such merchant groups in this tea stall; he pointed to the one nearest to them.

Both groups consisted of more than ten people. They gathered together respectively, eating and drinking quietly. Even their communication was in whispers, just like Li Qi and Ah Du.

Li Qi and Ah Du also kept their voices low when communicating; anyone slightly further away couldn't hear them at all.

However, somehow, it seemed they were heard.

"Hey, what do you mean?" Among the merchants Li Qi pointed at, a tall figure suddenly stood up.

He wore linen clothes and was about eight feet tall, a full foot taller than Li Qi. His physique was robust, his joints thick, and his body hair vigorous. His beard and chest hair connected in one piece, his appearance was fierce, and he wore a bamboo hat. He walked over, very dissatisfied.

"Ah, sorry, I was just giving an example." Li Qi immediately stood up and smiled apologetically.

Being heard talking about someone behind their back was quite awkward; _I better apologize._

That burly man walked halfway, heard Li Qi stand up and apologize, and snorted coldly. "Count yourself lucky you know what's good for you." After saying that, he went back.

This wasn't unexpected. Walking abroad, having a bad temper was fine, but if one wanted to start a fight over nothing and deepen conflicts, they definitely wouldn't travel far; most likely, they would die out in the wild.

Li Qi sat down, not feeling that he had lost face. However, through this incident, he understood why Ah Du didn't go with that bunch.

Ah Du also took the opportunity to explain in a whisper, "So... Big Brother Li, you know why I came to find you, right? If I went with them... I'm afraid not even my bones would be left."

Li Qi nodded, deeply agreeing.

With a violent temper that could make one stand up over a single word, combined with a large group banding together—if these merchant groups harbored any ill will, leaving aside whether they dared to commit murder personally, stripping Ah Du of his goods and throwing him directly into the wild to die without a whole corpse would be a very normal occurrence.

Dying in the wild, who would know how one died? The government probably wouldn't bother to investigate.

In other words, Ah Du chose Li Qi because he actually believed Li Qi didn't pose that great a threat. Ah Du, this person, had the confidence to escape with his life if he had to face a sudden attack from Li Qi alone.

While thinking about this, Li Qi suddenly froze.

Was he being a bit... neurotic?

It was just partnering up with someone to travel; for such a normal thing, why did it require this degree of scheming? Constantly testing, speculating in various ways, self-righteously inferring the other's motives.

"Sigh..." Li Qi shook his head and rubbed his temples.

One cannot do without a guarded heart, but that doesn't mean one needs to be like a hedgehog, treating everyone with extreme vigilance. Besides, Ah Du seemed to have no issues, and his various explanations added up. There was really no need to continue speculating about the other with malice.

Although he said he didn't feel much about killing people, it seemed it had still left some psychological shadow...

"Big Brother Li, why the sudden sigh?" It was Ah Du who saw Li Qi's expression suddenly change from previous wariness to a bitter smile and a shake of the head, and he was somewhat puzzled.

"Nothing. Let's finish eating quickly, rest well, and then hit the road." Li Qi didn't say much more, but he was no longer as repulsed by having someone by his side.

**Translator's Note**

Ah Du is engaging in a classic piece of Daoist wordplay. He is distinguising between two different Chinese characters that are pronounced exactly the same (qi) but have very different meanings. To a listener (like Li Qi), they sound identical, which is why Ah Du has to dip his finger in tea and write them out to show the difference.

1. The Common "Qi" (气)

It means air, breath, gas, weather.

This is the character used in everyday conversation (e.g., "weather" is _tianqi_, "air" is _kongqi_).

This is what most people think when they hear the word. It is "Post-Heaven" (acquired) breath that keeps your body alive physically, but it holds no power.

2. The Daoist "Qi" (炁)

It means primordial energy, vital essence, cosmic breath.

Notice the four dots at the bottom (灬). In Chinese characters, these dots usually represent fire. This character is often used in Daoist texts to represent energy that has been refined or alchemically processed, or energy that existed before the world was formed ("Pre-Heaven").

This is the "Treasure." It isn't just air; it is the metaphysical energy that acts as the bridge between your physical body (Essence/Jing) and your mind (Spirit/Shen).
