# Chapter 47: In the Gloom

Shen Shuibi was like an isolated island, completely out of place in this world.

Cold qi and Summer qi were both shut out by her; in fact, all the qi Li Qi himself could see had nothing to do with her.

Perhaps there were other types of qi that could be seen, but that was already beyond his range of observation.

Just like how he couldn't see the progress bar on Mr. Zhu.

Perhaps it had exceeded the scope of his abilities.

The power of the Outer Dao wasn't omnipotent, after all.

Li Qi tried to apply his knowledge, bringing the contents of the [Invocation] into reality.

He used this perspective, widening his eyes, wanting to see into the distance.

Then, he suddenly saw the light of the setting sun on the horizon shining over.

And the bits of cloud qi above his own head.

The yellow dusk of the setting sun dyed the cloud qi above Li Qi blood red!

Moreover, it seemed to be breathing, expanding and contracting, writhing.

"Green is for insects, white is for mourning, red is for the chaos of war, black is for floods, yellow is for harvest..." Li Qi mumbled, eyes wide, repeating those words.

_The cloud above my head... seems to be red, right?_

_Red is for the chaos of war—is bloodshed impending?_

_It must be a mistake, right? Just ordinary fire clouds from the sunset?_

_Fire clouds are red; that's very normal, right?_

Li Qi comforted himself this way.

However, he suddenly felt a burst of heart-pounding alarm.

Cold sweat instantly broke out; his heart thumped, beating faster involuntarily, causing his skin to turn somewhat red.

"Is this... a sudden premonition?" Li Qi wiped away the cold sweat.

The divination methods recorded in the [Book of Invocation] could absolutely not be baseless winds!

This meant the danger had not been avoided!

"Old Ma! Miss Shen! Get moving! Someone is definitely coming for us! Come help me make preparations!" Li Qi shouted loudly!

_Think... think a bit, what did the [Book of Invocation] say?_ Li Qi forced himself to calm down.

He hurriedly rummaged through the book. This time he only read roughly, searching specifically within the divination aspects, hoping to see a solution or perhaps some other method of divination.

Then he suddenly read a line of explanation.

"Wood born in spring flourishes with the season; though the pillars meet the palace of death and extinction, if moving towards the land of birth and prosperity, one shall not die." Li Qi slowly murmured this passage.

Wood born in spring...

Wood born in spring...

He fell into deep thought.

Night had fallen. The houses and villages in the valley were hidden in the heavy night, not clearly visible.

Baiyue had many mountains—this place was even called the Hundred Thousand Mountains—so most wild villages and stockades were situated within the dense mountains. The mountains also had the highest forest coverage, so the surroundings were mostly forests.

However, there are forests, and then there are _forests_.

Places where people resided permanently could not count as true 'forests.'

Humans naturally modified the surrounding environment, turning it into a shape suitable for their own existence.

In places farther from humans and villages.

In the places where the 'true forest' lay.

Huge cracks gaped in the surrounding rocks, spring water gurgling out from within. Vegetation grew thickly; towering trees twisted and coiled, some even split in half by lightning. Vines and plants entangled with one another; from afar, they looked like fragments scattered on a spiderweb. The air felt damp and sultry, which was normal. Inside the forest, the dense foliage, tall trunks, and marsh gas trapped the heat, preventing it from dissipating, raising the temperature further and making it stifling.

In the primeval jungles of the Hundred Thousand Mountains of Baiyue, all trees and shrubs grew together without restraint, forming no shape and following no rules at all.

Strange patterns filled every corner, as if the space itself had been twisted—this was a place that would make city dwellers accustomed to streets feel dizzy and dazzled.

Deep in this primeval jungle, the last glimmer of the setting sun reflected in the mountains, dyeing the originally green mountain streams and woods a bright red, as if flames were burning, or as if blinding fresh blood were rushing down from the valley.

The heat of the day faded rapidly, and the night wind, carrying traces of chill, grew stronger, blowing until one's hands and feet felt stiff.

In the pitch-black valley, this was a spot filled with a primitive aura. The omnipresent mossy rocks, broad-leaved shrubs, and climbing vines made the terrain exceptionally complex. Outside the distant valley lay the forest that blotted out the sky and sun, while to the right were several cave openings that looked as if they had been split by a blade, dark inside and leading to who knows where.

This place had almost never been trodden by humans; it was a paradise for demons.

Vines and plants entangled, making the path extremely difficult to traverse. Even professional hunters would inevitably find this place too rugged. Moreover, fierce beasts and carnivorous plants grew in abundance; it was an extremely dangerous place.

However, in this paradise for demons, a squad of soldiers had appeared.

A squad of soldiers wearing black armor, about ten men; the entire team was actually mounted!

Every soldier was equipped with a horse. The leader's horse was seven chi tall, spirit concentrated and brimming with divine qi. As it lifted its head, one could almost feel its arrogance.

Among them was a flag bearer; a flag hung from his long spear, dancing in the oncoming wind, making flapping sounds.

On that flag, spreading branches were painted, resembling a pine tree.

"Squad Leader, the place where that dragon colt last revealed itself is here. The bloodstains are still here. However, he took a strike from your halberd; he should be heavily injured," a soldier said to the officer.

"I infused that strike with baleful qi. He is definitely heavily injured and can't run far. There will definitely be traces within five hundred li. Keep searching," the officer spoke coldly.

"Right, Zhang Wu, your divination techniques could accurately predict the location before; why don't they work now?" The officer turned around and spoke to a soldier.

The soldier called Zhang Wu smiled bitterly. "Squad Leader, my father was a village spirit medium, so I only picked up some divination techniques by observing and listening; how could I count as a true Diviner?"

"However, I suspect that since it was effective before but is ineffective now, that dragon colt has likely met an expert. A high-ranking expert's presence naturally disturbs cause and effect, so divination techniques easily fail."

"I've heard that some high experts possess an Unsullied Body; filth cannot approach them, evil ghosts and demons cannot touch them, they are invaded by neither cold nor heat, and various techniques are greatly reduced in power against them. Even curses cannot attach to them, making them even harder to divine. By staying at their side, a shield naturally forms..." the soldier said.

The officer, however, sneered. "Unsullied Body? That would be at least a Daoist Rank Five high expert. They could crush all of us to death with a single finger; would they look upon a mere dragon colt? What they ride are true dragons!"

"So it is absolutely impossible to be that reason. It must be something else. What other possibilities are there?" he asked again.

"Then... it is also possible that the dragon colt encountered some place where qi clashes. For example, running into a city where human qi is vigorous, or a graveyard where death qi is vigorous. Once the qi clashes, the traces are concealed," he replied.

"That is possible. Search in that direction then," the officer ordered.
