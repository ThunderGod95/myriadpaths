# Chapter 48: Mountain Root

"Sigh... phew..." Shen Shuibi was so exhausted she couldn't straighten her back. "Li Qi, why are we... moving rocks? I am so tired."

As Shen Shuibi spoke, she steadied the basket on Old Ma's back.

The basket, fastened with vines, hung on Old Ma's side, while Shen Shuibi was responsible for keeping it steady and filling it with stones.

She couldn't carry them herself, so she could only pick them up piece by piece, place them into the basket on Old Ma's back, and let the old horse carry the load while she supported it from the side.

Li Qi, however, had no Old Ma to use. He could only move the stones himself, hoisting them up the mountain.

He was a boat tracker, after all, and being worked like a beast of burden was a common occurrence.

No, it would be more accurate to say that the very nature of a tracker's profession was to be treated like a beast of burden.

Hearing Shen Shuibi's confusion, Li Qi explained, "You had a sudden premonition, and I had one as well. The art of observing the five clouds also showed a disaster of weapons and bloodshed looming over my head, so I must make proper preparations."

"Of course I know we need to prepare... so, what does this have to do with moving rocks?" Her cultivation base was already completely ruined, and now, subjected to another wave of heavy physical labor, she was utterly exhausted, unable to resist questioning Li Qi.

Li Qi was carrying a massive boulder weighing three to four hundred catties, hauling it up the mountain. Hearing Shen Shuibi's question, he replied, "We are making a trap. There are mountains and rivers here, and among the three of us, only I have any combat strength. We really must prepare in advance."

"However, it is mostly done now. You and Old Ma go rest. I can handle the rest by myself; there isn't much left." Li Qi took a glance and saw that about one-third was still unfinished, but if he pushed himself, he should be able to complete it by midnight.

However, Shen Shuibi bit her lip and shook her head.

Old Ma also whinnied a few times and did not retreat, instead continuing to carry the rocks up the mountain.

Seeing this, Li Qi did not say anything more.

Upon reaching the top of the mountain, he immediately began using the rocks to arrange an altar.

Yes, he intended to use the sacrificial methods he had learned previously to see if he could scrape together a trump card.

"To the mountain god, sacrifice using pure-colored livestock..."[^1] Li Qi silently recited the phrasing from the Book of Invocation.

The term for sacrifice referred to pure-colored animals, specifically livestock meant for consumption.

To sacrifice to a mountain god, one should use pure-colored livestock as an offering.

Where was he supposed to find a pure-colored animal now?

Simple: wasn't Old Ma right beside him?

Although Old Ma was already aged, as a dragon colt, his coat was a pure, glossy black, looking exceedingly majestic.

Thus, he took his knife and walked over to Old Ma.

Old Ma was so frightened that he took two steps back.

"Enough already, stop putting on that pitiful look..." Li Qi scolded with a laugh. "It's not like I'm actually going to kill you."

Old Ma whinnied twice, looking extremely wronged.

But it was impossible for Li Qi to actually slaughter him for the sacrifice. They had spent several days together, after all, and Old Ma had grown somewhat close to him; he couldn't bring himself to do such a thing.

He used the knife to make a small cut on Old Ma's rump, collecting a small amount of horse blood, and then cut off a tuft from Old Ma's elegant, handsome mane.

Old Ma gave two aggrieved whinnies.

Li Qi smiled and slapped his rump. "I'll give you a wisp of the Azure Dragon's divine qi in a couple of days. Look at you, making such a fuss!"

Hearing this, Old Ma rejoiced and trotted off with his rump held high.

That minor wound didn't even need attending to; it stopped bleeding within twenty minutes. Li Qi had only taken about two hundred milliliters, an amount roughly equivalent to a nosebleed for an animal of Old Ma's size.

Meanwhile, Li Qi took Old Ma's blood and mane, placing them upon the stone-stacked altar.

"Carve the stone and set the stele, to settle the divine spirits..."

"To the mountain god of the southern shrine, with the pure-colored livestock and sweet wine, I offer this sacrifice..."

The 'sweet wine' originally required actual liquor, but since Li Qi lacked any at the moment, he drew upon another meaning of the word—sweet spring water. He had specifically asked Shen Shuibi to cross two mountains to fetch the crisp, refreshing water from another mountain spring.

The pure-colored livestock and the sweet spring, both were now complete.

The altar had also been constructed from stones. Furthermore, Li Qi had applied some mechanical principles, specifically conducting a stress analysis to ensure that even though this contraption looked like it was on the verge of collapsing, it wouldn't actually fall unless it was subjected to tremors.

Even if it did collapse, it would tumble toward the spring at the bottom of the cliff, never hitting him.

He determined the direction, faced south, and then presented the offerings.

Using the spine of his wood-chopping knife, Li Qi smashed open a relatively regular-shaped stone, barely chipping out a humanoid figure.

In truth, it could only be said that he had smashed out a stone weather doll; it could only pass as human if one squinted.

He placed this stone figure onto the altar.

Then, facing south, he commenced the Invocator's ritual.

All myriad spirits of heaven and earth inhale qi to achieve their Dao.

In this world, it was not only those mountain spirits and water monsters that could become gods; there was another path, and that was for the mountain itself to attain godhood.

This was incredibly difficult. Mountains possessed a spirit but lacked consciousness; without consciousness, there was no perception. They could not feel anything, nor did they have any way to practice a cultivation method.

Therefore, the mountain gods of the world were mostly spirits and monsters, rather than the grand mountains themselves.

But what Li Qi was about to do now was artificially fabricate a mountain god out of thin air.

Was it possible? Fundamentally, it was impossible.

To accomplish such a feat, it would require at least the population of an entire village worshipping month after month, lasting for decades. Generations of people nurturing it with the smoke of incense would be needed to incubate a sliver of spiritual intelligence. Only after it gradually awakened, and was then nourished by heavenly qi and earth qi for several centuries, could it possibly be born into the world.

Thus, what Li Qi was doing had a high probability of failing to secure the aid of a mountain god.

Yet, he himself knew this well.

If there truly was a mountain god willing to help him, then he could genuinely rest easy. There would be absolutely no danger whatsoever, but he wasn't counting on a meat pie to simply drop from the sky like that.

Hence, the primary purpose of this sacrifice was to exchange for a single thread of mountain root earth qi.

This particular method had actually been invented by other Invocators and recorded within the [Book of Invocation].

The principle relied upon the primal mountain spirits' characteristic of possessing spirit while lacking consciousness and perception. By calling forth a portion of the mountain spirit and placing it into the carved stone statue. This was the meaning of the first line he had chanted: Carve the stone and set the stele, to settle the divine spirits.

Then, he would offer sacrifice to this specific portion and present a wisp of his own qi, allowing it to be tainted by the characteristics of a human.

Through this, this isolated fraction of the mountain spirit would temporarily awaken its perception. However, much like a fetus still in the womb, although it possessed perception, it lacked spiritual wisdom.

In this way, the awakened segment of the mountain spirit and the original mountain spirit, despite being part of the same entity, would develop a discrepancy. It would be akin to one's own hand suddenly growing a brain of its own.

The mountain spirit itself would resist this change. Though unthinking and unfeeling, mountains and rivers inherently possessed a spirit, and they would actively purge any attempt to contaminate them.

Even though such contamination was nothing to them—mountain spirits were incredibly vast, and completely corrupting one with human qi would likely require the blood sacrifice of over a million people. Thus, a single wisp of one person's qi was truly no more than making the mountain spirit spit out a mouthful of saliva.

Therefore, the mountain spirit would sever this tiny fragment tainted by human qi and then depart. Afterward, it would never again respond to this person's sacrifices. Even if the mountain spirit truly became a god in the future, it would harbor a natural, innate disgust for this individual.

But Li Qi could no longer afford to care about so much.

This very portion that the mountain spirit spat out was exactly what Li Qi wanted.

Mountain root earth qi!
