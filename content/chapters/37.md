# Chapter 37: Rank

Li Qi flipped through the book for half an hour before finding the relevant records in [Invocation].

The book [Invocation] recorded: "In ancient times, there were Shentu and Yulei, two brothers whose nature was to govern ghosts. They lived on Mount Dushuo in the East Sea, where they stood under a peach tree and inspected the hundred ghosts. Should any ghost act without reason and maliciously bring disaster to people, Shentu and Yulei would bind it with reed ropes and feed it to a tiger."

Another record stated: "In the East Sea stands Mount Dushuo. On the mountain is a great peach tree, twisting and coiling for three thousand li. Between its branches to the northeast is where the hundred ghosts enter and exit. There are two divine men atop it, one called Shentu, the second called Yulei, who are masters of all ghosts. Evil and harmful ghosts are bound with reed ropes and fed to tigers. The Yellow Emperor then established the practice of placing great peachwood figures upon one's doors. He had paintings made of Shentu, Yulei, a tiger, and reed ropes, to ward off ghosts."

This meant that in ancient times, there were two brothers, Shentu and Yulei, who could restrain ghosts and lived on Mount Dushuo in the East Sea.

On this Mount Dushuo, there was a great peach tree, vast and sprawling for three thousand li.

At the northeast corner of the peach tree was a Ghost Gate, the place where myriad ghosts entered and exited. The brothers Shentu and Yulei were stationed there, responsible for supervision and guarding. If an unreasonable, evil ghost appeared committing crimes, Shentu and Yulei would arrest it, bind it with ropes woven from reeds, and take it to feed the tigers.

When the Yellow Emperor ruled the world, he saw that the world was in chaos and that wicked ghosts roamed freely, greatly disturbing the populace. So he taught the people to carve images of Shentu and Yulei from peachwood and hang them with ropes before their doors to prevent evil ghosts from invading.

Thus, Shentu and Yulei became the inner door gods.

In this record, Li Qi saw some gods he was familiar with, as well as astronomical knowledge he recognized.

_Although I don't know what relationship this world has with my original world..._

_But these folk customs, and even these ancient texts, do they match up?_

_The most crucial thing is that I can understand the language and writing. And what the hell, there's even a country here called the Tang Empire..._

_A coincidence?_

_Forget it, never mind all that. It doesn't really have anything to do with me._

_Let's take things as they come._

For the rite to the inner door gods, Li Qi tried a different method this time.

He placed the willow branch that Young Master Zhu had given him upon the altar.

This time, a wisp of divine qi from the inner door gods entered the willow branch.

This was also a method recorded in [Invocation]. The dharma artifacts and divine tools used by Shamans and Invocators were mostly created using this method.

With a wisp of divine qi infused within it, the willow branch visibly became more lustrous, but it did not undergo a qualitative change.

This was quite normal. It was the willow branch Young Master Zhu had given him; it must have already contained the divine qi of an Earthly Divinity.

However, after being infused with the divine qi of the gods Shentu and Yulei, the willow branch clearly gave off a different feeling.

According to the records in the book, its ability to strike ghosts should have become stronger.

_A good thing, a good thing. It's good to strengthen my equipment right now._

The rite for the Earthly Divinities was also complete, but Li Qi did not perform a rite for the Human Ghosts.

This was because Human Ghosts were one's ancestors, but he, in fact, had no ancestors in this world. He was a person of the Outer Dao.

As an outsider to this world, regarding the matter of Human Ghosts, unless he gained the acknowledgment of a Human Ghost spirit in the future or married into a family, it was unlikely he would need to perform such a rite.

After busying himself with all this, Li Qi, who had woken up at three in the morning, looked up to see that the sun had already risen.

Fortunately, after everything, he felt no fatigue. On the contrary, nourished by the vital qi of wood, he felt full of vigor.

Shen Shuibi was still fast asleep, not having opened her eyes once all night. She slept very soundly.

Compared to the cautious Li Qi, she, a fugitive with a hundred-gold bounty on her head, seemed to have no stress at all.

One could only say that being single-minded was quite practical in some ways.

_I should let her sleep... the room fee was paid by Young Master Zhu anyway._

With these thoughts, Li Qi willingly deactivated the Ox Strength Art and walked outside.

"Based on my current situation, what rank would I be considered?" He tested his hand strength, murmuring to himself.

Using Shaman God Mountain's own classification, Li Qi felt that he was currently just an ordinary, barely initiated Invocator. He even had to look up the proper procedures for rites on the spot. The two simple daily rites this morning had taken him a full three hours, and he had to wake up in the middle of the night to do them. He was at a level that could barely be distinguished from an amateur.

And the Invocators' own classification was difficult to compare with others when viewed from the perspective of the entire world.

Therefore, to "standardize the world," the sages established a method applicable to all cultivation paths—a grading system from Rank 9 to Rank 1.

Li Qi really wanted to mock the phrase "standardize the world," but after careful thought, this system might have more than just symbolic meaning... It was very likely a struggle among the great powers for control over the 'Dao.'

Perhaps, this thing really could standardize the world, restraining all cultivators just like the Heavenly Dao.

Putting aside such grand and ethereal matters, Li Qi had also learned in detail about this ranking method.

Rank 9 to Rank 1 were actually divided based on one's influence and understanding of the "Dao," and had nothing to do with combat prowess.

Cultivators of the War Dao and Sword Dao, when fighting types not so adept at combat like the Diviners of the Shaman Dao, could kill those of higher rank as easily as eating and drinking, but their influence on the Dao was certainly far inferior.

Because of this difference, a Rank 5 Diviner of the Shaman Dao, facing a War Dao cultivator one rank lower than themselves—that is, Rank 6—could very likely be beaten like a dog in a head-on fight.

But then again, as long as this Diviner hid and relied on divination arts, or even cursing arts, to play the other to death, it wouldn't be difficult.

Or perhaps, a Medicine Dao cultivator, even if cultivated to a high rank, probably wouldn't have much capacity for widespread destruction.

But a Shaman Dao Invocator, with the protection of Earthly Divinity and mountain god divine qi, could cause a localized earthquake at Rank 8.

In summary, this rank division only looked at the grade of the Dao. Although it had some relation with expressive power and combat power, the relationship wasn't big; lethality mainly depended on the method of cultivation.

But rank wasn't just for show. If a certain path reached a high rank, it would naturally have its own means. They might not be so good at fighting, but they were absolutely irreplaceable or even unique.

According to the classification, Ranks 8, 9, and 7 were the lowest, meaning the stage from just entering the door to gradually becoming familiar.

Ranks 6, 5, and 4 were the experts within the field, counting as masters of a region, with deep understanding of their own Dao and some unique methods.

Ranks 3, 2, and 1 counted as masters of the current age, generally sect leaders or heads of major powers.

In the miscellaneous chapters of [Invocation], it was recorded that the Shaman Dao had Shaman Gods, the Daoist Sects had True Immortals, the Confucians had Sages, and the Martial Dao had Human Immortals.

Legend had it that above these, there were even higher levels; Rank 1 was not the ultimate.

But the book did not record what lay beyond, perhaps feeling it was unnecessary.

As for Li Qi...

He confirmed it again and again.

He should be... Unranked.

That's right, Unranked. He would have to wait until he had at least mastered the rites for the four seasons and continuously performed them for the most common Heavenly Gods of the four seasons and the five household Earthly Divinities for a full year. Only when the qi of the four seasons was present within his personal cosmos and the divine qi of the five household gods protected his body, could he estimate himself to be Rank 9...

"Sigh, the burden is heavy and the road is long. Only by diligently ploughing and weeding for a year can I truly enter the ranks?"
