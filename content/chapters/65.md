# Chapter 65: Shifting the Misfortune

Without a doubt, the moment Shen Shuibi stepped out, she immediately attracted the gaze of everyone in the shop.

Li Qi never expected that merely changing her clothes, combing her unkempt hair, and adding an ordinary wooden hairpin could make such a massive difference.

Therefore, Li Qi hurriedly paid. He had originally planned to haggle and press the price down a bit, but after this scene, he didn't dare. He grabbed Shen Shuibi and walked right out.

"Excuse me, excuse me..." he said with an embarrassed smile to the surrounding passersby, pulling along Shen Shuibi, who was radiating happiness in her new clothes.

Based on their month of interaction and his understanding of Shen Shuibi, Li Qi dared to bet that she had absolutely no awareness of the stares from the outside world. The smile on her face was born of pure happiness.

Just like a little child who had received a new toy.

She was purely happy, but as Li Qi pulled her onto the street, the surrounding glares practically nailed him to death.

And Li Qi was unwilling to deprive Shen Shuibi of the joy of wearing her new clothes. If he made her change back just to avoid drawing attention...

_That would make me seem like absolute trash, wouldn't it?_

Even if they attracted some attention, he should still be able to protect her.

An unknown source of pride caused Li Qi to discard his usual extreme caution, and instead, he magnanimously pulled Shen Shuibi along as they walked toward the city outskirts.

Fortunately, the Great Deer Kingdom, generally speaking, could be considered a country with strict laws, even though this strictness was only reflected on the surface.

But that surface-level strictness was enough to prevent anyone from making a move in broad daylight.

As for the night...

In this world, no one would leave the city during the night.

Li Qi pulled Shen Shuibi all the way out of the city and into the wilderness. They hiked into the mountain ridges and forests, entering the non-human domain of the Hundred Thousand Mountains.

He blew a whistle.

Shen Shuibi covered her ears, her entire body trembling and twisting. Her expression contorted into a mask of pain, her face cycling between blue and purple.

She absolutely couldn't stand such a piercing sound; perhaps this was the price of a rabbit's sensitive hearing.

But only a sound like this could travel far enough.

Soon, a whinnying sound drifted over. Old Ma let out a neigh in the distance, responding to the call.

It wasn't long before a handsome and elegant horse galloped over. Wind gathered beneath his hooves, with cloud qi following in tandem. He moved as if flying through the forest, charging up to Li Qi at an incredible speed and affectionately rubbing his equine face against him.

"Alright, you two spend the night here first. I'm going to buy some other things needed for traveling in the wilderness, as well as a map. Old Ma, what do you want to eat? Beans? Oats?" Li Qi said to Old Ma.

Old Ma neighed and stamped his hooves.

Shen Shuibi immediately translated. "He says he wants oats, preferably mixed with sweet beets."

"Quite demanding, aren't we? Fine, I'll bring some back for you later." Li Qi patted the horse's back, then turned to Shen Shuibi. "You two wait here for now. With Old Ma around, nothing should be able to catch you. I'll probably be back tonight. If I can't make it by tonight, I'll definitely be back tomorrow morning. I have to deal with that gold. Oh, right—give me another lock of Old Ma's mane." As he spoke, Li Qi used his knife to cut a tuft of Old Ma's mane, prompting the horse to shake his head in displeasure.

He had a sinking feeling that, given enough time, Li Qi would leave his beautiful mane completely bald.

"Mhm, alright. Old Ma and I will wait here for your return," Shen Shuibi nodded.

She had always been this easygoing.

Although she was a bit dense, she was ultimately a ruthless person capable of crippling her own cultivation base.

Li Qi would sometimes ask himself: if he had cultivated for hundreds or a thousand years and finally reached Rank 5 with great difficulty, could he so easily cripple his own cultivation base?

It was hard to say, but he definitely wouldn't be as relieved and at peace as Shen Shuibi.

So far, he had never seen Shen Shuibi look discouraged over losing her cultivation base. She always seemed to be in a good mood, and even when she was occasionally unhappy, she quickly bounced back.

It was as if those lost thousand years of cultivation hadn't belonged to her at all.

It was as if falling from a lofty immortal figure to a frail woman who lacked the strength to truss a chicken—having to rely on a mortal like him to survive—wasn't worth mourning at all.

What a resolute state of mind.

Of course, it was also possible that she was just dense and hadn't realized it.

But Li Qi felt that was unlikely.

Although Shen Shuibi's personality was a bit dense and cute, her bottomless experience and foundational knowledge were evident to all.

Being dense didn't mean having low intelligence. How could someone who remembered so many things be a fool?

Therefore, Li Qi actually quite admired Shen Shuibi.

After settling these matters, Li Qi tidied up his money and handed the luggage over to Shen Shuibi for safekeeping.

Following that, he headed back to the city alone.

He still had to resolve the matter regarding the gold.

The method he thought of to dispose of this piece of gold without taking a loss, bearing any risks, or shifting the misfortune onto innocent people, was to use the money to hold a sacrifice.

He prepared to steel his heart, spend the money, and host a small-scale sacrifice.

Sacrifice to whom?

To the Earthly Divinity he was most familiar with.

The God of the Li River within Azure Splendor Palace.

The very entity he was most familiar with, the Earthly Divinity whose Grand Rite he participated in every year—the river god of the Li River, to whom he had already sacrificed three times!

"Come, right, just place it like this."

"The altar goes right here. That's right, place it here."

"Wait a moment, you'll be responsible for beating the drum here. Just striking this small drum will be fine."

Li Qi directed a few manual laborers.

At a wage of ten coins per person, he had hired them to help set up a small ritual space for sacrificing to the river god.

The setup included wood, meat offerings, small paper boats, spices, and Old Ma's mane.

A pure-colored dragon colt was incredibly useful.

All of this cost Li Qi a total of two thousand three hundred coins, including the manual labor.

To be honest, his heart bled at the expense.

However, he had originally intended to do this anyway; the cursed gold merely helped him finalize his resolve.

As an Invocator, he had never before held a sacrifice involving more than one person; this time was considered breaking the ice.

This kind of multi-person sacrifice was the true method for obtaining a substantial amount of power.

Now, just thinking about the scale of the River Breaking ceremony... Li Qi couldn't help but shudder.

Every year during the River Breaking, over a hundred thousand people would busy themselves with it, bringing countless offerings and adhering to strict etiquette.

As the host of that ceremony, exactly how much power did the Governor of Li Prefecture obtain?

_Forget it, let's not think about those things and focus on my own sacrificial ground._

With everything prepared, Li Qi stepped forward, presented the offerings, and sent the folded paper boats drifting into the Li River.

Among the offerings, prominently included, was that piece of gold!

Offering gold to the gods was a traditional part of sacrifice. Was there a problem with that?

Meats, alcohol, gold, and the dragon colt's mane—everything was carried out according to proper etiquette.

_Damn it, who cares what disaster or curse this thing carries? If it's so capable, let it go bother the God of the Li River!_

Li Qi refused to believe it. Could this kind of thing clash against this big shot?
