# Chapter 38: Qi

Li Qi skipped breakfast that morning, opting instead for a stroll to test his ability to observe "qi."

He saw it; there was water qi within the river.

This qi flowed through the city, dragging the city's Yin qi along with it, merging it into the river, and carrying it all away.

He could see the beggars sleeping on the streets, coughing; inside their bodies, and even within their breath, there was a mixture of sickness qi.

*It must be sickly qi,* he thought. He didn't recognize it specifically, merely taking a wild guess.

Normal people possessed both Yin and Yang qi, while simultaneously harboring Defensive qi, Nutritive qi, Vital qi, and so on. Many types of qi were mixed together, and he simply couldn't distinguish them clearly yet.

It was just like a forest; from a distance, it looked lush and verdant, appearing as merely a patch of green. Only by venturing deep inside could one know that the forest was actually an ecosystem possessing countless species, with animals and plants too numerous to count, making it impossible to identify every single one at a glance.

Qi seemed to be like the atoms of this world; it was the fundamental component of all matter. Everything was constituted of qi, and the nature of the qi determined the nature of the matter.

It was just a pity that the book [Invocation] did not describe the principles of qi in detail; it only recorded the nature of qi commonly used in rituals or cultivation and the means to utilize it.

According to the book, the Daoist Sects were the experts in studying qi, while the Shaman Dao was comparatively inferior in this aspect.

Li Qi strolled while studying the book in his mind, devouring the knowledge within it like a starving man. He knew that this was the foundation for his future survival, so he dared not slack off in the slightest.

He could also see the progress bar for his reading of this book...

Of course, it was very, very, very, very slow.

After reading urgently for three hours upon waking up, and carefully reading for another two hours outside, the progress bar was still at 0%.

Which meant he hadn't even finished reading 0.1%.

Just how many things were recorded in this book... was it really just a massive database?

He estimated he would have to read for a year or a half to finish it.

He read like this, waiting until the sun had completely risen.

Then, the entire city came alive.

The bustling crowds—some leaving the city, some entering from outside—the grooms pulling carts, the shop assistants delivering goods to various stores, the cooking smoke curling upwards... the entire city stirred to life in an instant.

The weaver started her loom, the farmer walked out shouldering his hoe, shops opened their doors, and the government office struck the bell; everyone woke up, busying themselves with their day's livelihood.

The city at night was like a slumbering giant beast, but now, it had awakened.

Li Qi was deeply shaken by this scene!

Qi! Qi surging straight into the clouds!

He didn't know how to describe it, but it was simply shocking.

It was as if a heaven-shaking giant beast was awakening; the qi on its body was magnificent, terrifying, shooting straight into the clouds.

The qi of the constellations in the sky could not compare, and the qi of the Earthly Divinities on the ground could only retreat before it. The qi of countless people formed a singular presence, possessing an indescribable pressure.

What should this be called... Human qi?

Li Qi felt as though he could see law, order, human spirit, and vitality.

This qi, operating in a slow, methodical manner, supported a "city"!

A city was not just a pile of buildings placed together.

A city is to contain the people, just as a vessel is to contain millet.

For the first time, Li Qi understood the concept of a nation so intuitively, and at the same time, he grasped more clearly what a "city" truly was.

"This... this is the Human Dao?" Li Qi could not help but mutter to himself under the weight of such an imposing presence, a slight stutter coloring his words.

He was very clever, almost instantly drawing a line from the books he had read to the prior discussion with Young Master Zhu about the conflict between the Human Dao and the Shaman Dao.

He guessed—perhaps he could call this realization...

This was the Human Dao.

This qi was the power of the Human Dao!

At this moment, he, a Shaman Invocator, was deeply shaken by the power of the Human Dao.

And this was merely a county seat! Feng County only had twenty-something thousand people!

Then what kind of concept was the Li Prefecture City?

If it was a provincial capital of the Tang Empire, what kind of concept would that be? If it was the capital of the Tang Empire, known as the center of the Human Dao, then what sort of spectacle would that be!?

Li Qi wiped away the Azure Dragon's divine qi attached to his eyes.

Everything before his eyes immediately returned to normal.

The endless flowing traffic of horses and carriages, the surging tide of people—a perfectly ordinary day in Feng County had begun.

Every day was like this.

But a storm raged in Li Qi’s heart, refusing to calm.

*This… is the world of cultivators?*

The power of a mere county seat was already so intense; then, if his guess from last night happened to be true...

The Nine Ranks Classification System that regulated the cultivators of the entire world—what level of power was that?

If he were able to see it, what kind of sight would it be?

The laws and decrees that constrained the entire Tang Empire—if he could see them, what form would they take?

Li Qi didn't even dare to think about it; he felt that all of this had already exceeded the limits of his imagination.

He began to miss the Li Prefecture City a little.

The opening of the morning market in a normal county seat was already this spectacular.

Then the annual River Breaking ritual—if he were allowed to see it now, what kind of grand occasion would that be!?

"This is the world of cultivation?" He took a deep breath.

He couldn't see it now, but would he be unable to see it in the future as well?

As long as he climbed up step by step, there would always be a day when he could see it with his own eyes!

At this moment, Li Qi had never been so eager to cultivate; it seemed as if all his motivation had ignited, and he couldn't wait to become strong.

Not for any glory or wealth, not to become a superior man, nor did he have deep hatred or ancient grievances. He was neither oppressed nor pursued by some calamity.

There weren't that many strange and bizarre reasons.

He just wanted to see.

He wanted to see the "Dao" higher up!

The Human Dao in a small county seat in a remote region was already so magnificent.

Then what of the others?

He wanted to climb up and see, to climb to the very peak, to the highest point, and take in the "Dao" of the entire world!

Overwhelmed with emotion, Li Qi could feel his heart hammering in his chest.

His blood boiled.

He clenched his fists, struggling to calm himself.

A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.

No matter how much he dreamed, he was currently just an unranked minor Shaman Invocator, probably just at the level of a village Spirit Medium.

He might be even worse; a village Spirit Medium had a lifetime of experience, while he had jack shit—he even had to flip through a book and copy the steps one by one just to cultivate or perform a ritual.

"I still have to learn, read, and accumulate progress every day," he thought to himself.

Unfortunately, his daily cultivation only needed to be performed once. Doing it more was of no benefit, utterly useless.

Therefore, if he wanted to improve quickly, he had to rely on other things.

"A horse doesn't fatten without night fodder; a man doesn't get rich without a windfall," Li Qi muttered to himself. To improve quickly at this stage, he would have to rely on his great patron, Young Master Zhu.

Then, finding Lady Luofu sooner—since the other party was also a big shot, he might be able to squeeze some oil and water from her too.

He had to set off early!
