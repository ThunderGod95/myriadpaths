# Chapter 36: Cultivation

_Could the progress bar... fail?_

_Was the opponent simply too strong?_

Li Qi thought to himself.

However, he immediately cast these thoughts aside.

There was no need to dwell on such distractions; it was better to focus on how to cultivate first. That was the true path.

"The season is Spring. 'Spring' (春) implies 'stirring' (蠢蠢). Its position is in the East. Its color is Azure. Its note is Jue; Jue signifies the qi moving and shining forth. Its emperor is Taihao; Hao means the great rousing and stirring of the myriad things. Its spirit is Gou Mang; signifying the beginning of life for all things, and its essence is the Azure Dragon; 'Mang' implies 'sprouting'."

(TL: The cultural context here is quite extensive. Please see my detailed article: [Spring, the Beginning of Life for All Things](/myriadpaths/mythology/spring/))

Rites were not simply a matter of kneeling and begging; that was merely a small part. Li Qi looked at the instructions within [Invocation]. First, he needed to take ash and water and sprinkle them in a winding path from outside the door, circling into the room. This was called [Leading the Dragon Back].

After that, he had to burn herbs. He grabbed a handful from outside, lit them, and waved them around. This was called [Smoking Insects].

There were other steps, such as [Frying Beans] and the [Rain Dance], fulfilling the rites of food and drink. Only after this full sequence was the rite considered complete.

Although he didn't have fried beans, he substituted them with rice cakes.

_It should be fine._

Li Qi busied himself for nearly half an hour before finally finishing.

Then, he felt it—a peculiar change in his body.

The dragon-shaped constellation rising in the East projected a stream of qi into his body.

A peculiar power.

It was impossible to describe.

He simply felt that he seemed to have become stronger. And then... there was a sensation of vibrant vitality.

This was very normal. Spring was the time when Heaven and Earth communicated, when the ten thousand things began to grow, and when Yin and Yang intersected. The Azure Dragon belonged to the East of the Four Symbols; Wood presided over the East and corresponded to Spring. Wood signifies 'breaking forth'; it is the breaking and stirring of Yang qi, bursting from the earth to be born. Water flows East to birth Wood. Wood grows upward and shelters what is below; such is its natural quality

Earlier, water was used to draw forth wood, achieving the dragon's return. Water generates wood, and the qi becomes immeasurable. Things have reached their proper time—branches and leaves flourish densely into a forest, embodying the prosperity of Wood. When wood grows, its spirit becomes vigorous and thriving. Thus, it is called Great Forest Wood.

This was a power representing the breath of life, and it was the power that could be obtained from the rites and prayers at this very moment.

Li Qi felt the exhaustion from his two days of tossing and turning vanish completely.

His vital energy was abundant, and even the emptiness of primordial Qi caused by the Ox Strength Art had been replenished!

His barren inner cosmos finally ushered in the first wisp of external qi.

It was like sweet rain after a long drought. A vibrant, life-filled power flooded his body. Li Qi even felt as if he had grown taller.

A sudden enlightenment rose in his heart, and even the world before his eyes changed.

He... had truly stepped onto the path of cultivation. He now walked the Shaman Dao, the path of the Invocator, and his branch was the Earthly Divinity.

After truly guiding qi into his body, he felt that his perception of the world had altered.

Under the guidance of the Great Forest Wood qi, he seemed able to faintly see the different qis between Heaven and Earth.

The Heavens had Heavenly qi, the Earth had Earthly qi, humans had Human qi, demons had Demon qi, and gods had Divine qi. For different entities, the nature of their qi also varied.

The various qis differed. Take Heavenly qi—it included the eight winds[^1] and six pitches[^2], which assisted Heaven and Earth in bringing forth all things. Like music, they harmonized qi to transform the myriad people and fulfill their nature and destiny.[^3]

There was the Qi of Taicu, symbolizing the birth of all things.[^4]

Yin qi lay beneath the Yellow Springs, nourishing all things.[^5]

There were many, many classifications of qi: Summer qi, Dew qi, Miscellaneous qi, and so on.

When different qis gathered, they could produce different effects.

Just as humans are born from the interaction of Yin and Yang qi.

Thunder is the exhalation of Yang qi.

The qi of Wu Earth can give birth to rosy clouds.[^6] Earth has no exclusive qi; it relies on fire for its birth and borrows from the sun for its manifestation.[^7]

Clouds, then, are the qi of mountains and marshes.[^8]

The book [Invocation] stated: "Heaven, Earth, and the ten thousand things are all born of qi. The interaction and transformation of qi give birth to all things. Therefore, where qi gathers, one can know the origin of its kind."

This meant that countless types of qi came together to create this world. As long as one could distinguish the nature and abilities of all qi, one could understand the origin of the world.

For example, the four seasons were the rotation of six qis to form the four times. The four seasons were the result of the cycle of six types of qi: Yin qi, Yang qi, Wind qi, Rain qi, Dark qi, and Bright qi.

As the saying goes: "The heavens have six qi, which are called yin, yang, wind, rain, dark, and bright."[^9]

Li Qi didn't recognize most of the qis, and only barely recognized a small portion introduced in [Invocation]. However, at this moment, he couldn't care about so much. He circulated the Great Forest Wood qi he had just obtained and opened his eyes to gaze at all the qi around him.

By attaching qi to his eyes, he could observe other qis.

Although this would incur consumption, it wasn't huge. Someone like Li Qi, who had just guided qi into his body, could maintain it for an hour or so before it ended.

In this state, Li Qi could even see the Nutritive qi and Defensive qi on the sleeping Shen Shuibi.

It was all nascent qi. It seemed she hadn't been lying. The qi on her body was very weak and extremely new. He could sense that it was definitely the result of having her cultivation destroyed and starting anew.

At the same time, he activated the Ox Strength Art.

For the current him, the Ox Strength Art no longer had a ten-minute time limit. Instead, it would only end when the qi in his personal cosmos was exhausted.

Of course, the limit of three times a day still existed.

He now understood why there was a three-time daily limit. It was because... that Earthly Divinity, the Qiong Ox, was unwilling to grant its power whenever someone desired it, lest it seem cheap... so if someone borrowed its strength three consecutive times, it would refuse.

_How willful._

The Ox Strength Art, when activated with Great Forest Wood qi, seemed to possess improved endurance, a result determined by the nature of the qi.

Moreover, he could also sense the process...

This spell art did not come from nothing. When he activated it, he could feel a faint stream of qi transmitted from the unseen world.

That was the divine qi of the Earthly Divinity, the Qiong Ox.

This divine qi brought the extraordinary abilities of thickened skin, flourishing Yang qi, and ample strength, allowing Li Qi to possess the combat power to fight ten men alone.

The new characteristics brought to this spell art by the Wood qi were due to the compatibility of the qis. Li Qi felt his endurance had become stronger. Before, although his explosive power was fierce, there would always be a time when he needed to recover his breath. Now, however, he didn't need to; he could throw many punches at full power in one go.

Having finished the rite for the Heavenly God and obtained his first wisp of Great Forest Wood qi, Li Qi, without hesitation, began the second round: the rite for the Earthly Divinities.

At this time of year, which Earthly Divinity should be worshipped?

In this season, one should perform a rite for the five household gods.

Who are the five household gods? They are the gods of the outer gate, the inner door, the well, the stove, and the central hall. Why are they worshipped? Because they preside over the places people enter and exit and where they eat and drink; they are therefore worshipped as gods.

But this, too, had its own particularities.

Why are the five household gods worshipped once a year? To follow the cycle of the five elements.

Therefore, in Spring, one worships the inner door god. The inner door is where people enter and exit, just as in Spring the ten thousand things begin to touch the door and emerge.

In summer, one worships the stove god, master of fire, by which one nourishes oneself. Summer is also when fire reigns, nurturing the growth of all things.

In autumn, one worships the outer gate god. The outer gate is for closing and securing oneself. Autumn is also when the ten thousand things mature and prepare to protect themselves from within.

In winter, one worships the well god. The well is where water is born and stored within the earth. Winter is also when water reigns, and all things lie dormant.

In the sixth month, one worships the central hall god. The central hall symbolizes earth at the center. The sixth month is also when earth is king.

Thus, the book [Invocation] clearly stated: "In spring, the rite is for the inner door god."

The rite for the inner door god was, in fact, a rite for the two gods Shentu and Yulei.

These two Earthly Divinities were adept at controlling malevolent ghosts, and so were enshrined as the inner door gods.

To perform their rite, Li Qi took out his willow branch.

[^1]: Eight Winds (八风):  Refers to winds from the eight compass directions (cardinal and intercardinal). In cosmology, these winds mark seasonal shifts and the arrival of specific Qi essential for growth.
[^2]: Six Pitches (六律): Ancient Chinese musical tuning standards. Here, they represent the rhythmic laws of the universe; just as music has structure, Qi flows in a harmonious pattern to create life.
[^3]: Nature and Destiny (性命): A core Daoist concept. "Nature" (Xing) refers to one's innate spirit and character, while "Destiny" (Ming) refers to one's physical life force and lifespan. Here, it implies the universe's "music" helps beings perfect both.
[^4]: **Taicu (太蔟)** is the third note of the **Twelve Lü** (Twelve-Tone system), which is the standardized system of musical tuning used in ancient China.

    It corresponds to the 1st month of Spring and symbolizes the time of year when the Yang qi is rising, and all living things are beginning to sprout and cluster together for life as winter ends.
[^5]: **Yellow Springs:** The Chinese underworld or realm of the dead. In this context, it refers to the deep earth where Yin qi gathers to nourish the roots of life form below.
[^6]: **Wu Earth (戊土):** Represents Yang Earth (solid mountains or dry cliffs).
[^7]: In Five Elements theory, Fire generates Earth, meaning Earth relies on Fire/Sun to gain strength and "appear."
[^8]: A classical definition found in texts like the Shuowen Jiezi: clouds are viewed as the "breath" or exhalation of mountains and marshes rising into the sky.
[^9]: These are the six basic elements of fundamental forces of nature:

    * **Yin & Yang:** Cold and Heat (Temperature)
    * **Wind & Rain:** Movement and Moisture (Weather)
    * **Bright & Dark:** Dark and Light (Day/Night Cycle)

    It is being explained that the "Four Seasons" (Time) are just a complex mix of these six basic elements rotating:

    * **Winter:** Dominance of Yin and Dark (Cold and Dark)
    * **Summer:** Dominance of Yang and Bright (Heat and Light)
    * **Spring/Autumn:** The mixing of Wind and Rain
