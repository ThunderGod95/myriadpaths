# Chapter 42: Baleful Qi

It was indeed the neighing of a horse, yet it sounded unusually human. One could even hear sobbing tones of agony within it.

Merely listening to it made one feel the pain in their own body.

"He must have gained sentience. He isn't a mere beast anymore; he just hasn't taken human form yet," Shen Shuibi said. At the same time, her address shifted from 'it' to 'he.'

In the language of this world, 'it' and 'he' had different pronunciations, so the distinction was very clear.

"Then we should be able to communicate. I'll speed up!" Li Qi said.

He took a deep breath, holding it to build strength, and continued his sprint through the mountains.

Leaping over obstacles, crossing mountain streams, swimming through creeks, climbing down cliffs, and bursting through thickets—after running for two quarters of an hour, Li Qi felt he had covered at least ten _li_.

Shen Shuibi could hear from this far away?

From over ten _li_ away, she could hear a horse neighing?

_This... she truly lives up to being a rabbit demon._

However, soon enough, Li Qi saw it. There was indeed a horse in the mountain stream not far away.

"Whoa... he looks miserable," Li Qi frowned, somewhat stunned.

Looking from this spot, the horse was extremely agile, leaping through the mountains. A single bound could cover six or nine _zhang_, clearing gullies ten _zhang_ wide.

But this horse looked to be in very bad shape.

No saddle, but he had horseshoes. He shouldn't be a wild horse; wild spirit horses were unlikely to be shod.

There were many wounds on his skin. Some wounds even had white worms wriggling in them—maggots, perhaps.

The horse looked skeletal, though one could tell from the frame that he was very large, at least eight _chi_ tall.

"Let's help him, what do you say?" Shen Shuibi poked Li Qi's shoulder.

"Mutual aid, mutual aid. We help him, he gives us a ride," Li Qi nodded. Since they were lucky enough to encounter such a horse, helping each other out was no issue.

So, Shen Shuibi climbed up from Li Qi's back, shifting from being carried to a riding posture, and raised her hand high. "Hey! Over here!"

"Can he understand you shouting like that?" Li Qi asked curiously.

"Look how tall he is; he definitely understands," Shen Shuibi said with certainty.

"Why do you say that?" Li Qi asked.

"The ancient _Book of Rites_ says: 'A horse over eight _chi_ tall is a dragon.' This horse is so tall, he already counts as a dragon colt. He has definitely gained sentience, he just hasn't taken human form like me yet."

"Besides, look, he isn't just tall. While galloping, there are even faint clouds and mist beneath his hooves. The ancient text _Records of Strange Things_ states: 'Once, a host of dragons emerged from the water and entered the Han River. The largest were several _zhang_, the smallest over a _zhang_, and they were the colors of the five directions, some having the form of oxen, horses, donkeys, or sheep.' These all speak to the similarities between horses and dragons."

"It is said that the dragon has many scions, and the horse is one of them! Moreover, the form of the horse is found among the many features of the dragon. You see, the very expression 'vigor of a dragon and horse' is enough to prove the connection."[^1]

"The _Lunheng_ has a chapter on Dragon Void, which states: 'Secular paintings depict the dragon with a horse's head and a snake's tail,' making the dragon 'a kind of horse and snake.' The 'Explanation of Dragons' chapter in the _Erya_ states that a dragon's head is similar to a horse's head. Look at that horse—tall and elegant. Though injured, he is still nimble. A horse's form is like a dragon's form; he must be a dragon steed!"

Shen Shuibi spoke with ceaseless eloquence, quoting various ancient texts and chapters as if they were second nature, leaving Li Qi utterly dumbfounded.

This girl, silly as she was, truly had a rich reserve of knowledge.

With such strong rote memorization, how come her intelligence seemed a bit lacking?

Shen Shuibi didn't know what Li Qi was thinking. Watching the horse run toward them, she continued to explain, "What's more, even if he isn't a dragon colt, horses still possess dragon nature."

"The _Classic of Mountains and Seas_ records: 'The horse is the essence of the dragon, born of the waters.' The Tang Empire has a text, _Memorial on the Dragon Horse_, which narrates: 'A horse gave birth to a dragon foal... its body had scales but no hair.' Beyond that, even I have heard that a unique horse was found west of the river in Lingchang Commandery. It had dragon scales and a serpent's tail. It traveled to the west of Xianyang, entered the Wei River, transformed into a dragon, and swam away, its destination unknown. You see, even ordinary horses possess a draconic nature to some degree."

Speaking to this point, she sat on Li Qi's shoulder, excitedly grabbed his hair, and said happily, "Maybe he came here because he sensed the Azure Dragon divine qi on you!"

"Look, he's injured so severely. The Azure Dragon divine qi on you happens to be the Great Forest Wood qi, which is thickest during the spring season and possesses excellent vitality. That's why he's rushing over here!"

"Easy! Easy!" Li Qi jumped in pain from having his hair yanked.

_Am I going to get a bald spot?_

_Hair follicles don't seem to grow back once pulled out..._

Li Qi shivered.

_Forget it, now is not the time to worry about going bald. Better to look at that horse first._

After being scolded by Li Qi, Shen Shuibi embarrassedly put her hand down, but her eyes clearly flickered with excited light as she waited for the horse to run toward them.

Li Qi also looked at the approaching horse, but the more he looked, the more alarmed he became.

Not only was it injured, but this horse also looked very old.

The skin was loose, the hooves were full of wounds, and the mane was filthy, clotted into clumps by coagulated blood and dirt.

Yes, clumps, not strands. The mane was completely stuck together, and the color was unhealthy, presenting a mix of brown and grizzled white, looking just like the graying hair of an old person.

In addition, he was lame in one leg. There was a knife wound about a foot long on his thigh. It appeared to be an old injury, but because it had festered for a long time without healing, maggots were squirming in the wound, and pus was constantly oozing out.

Apart from that, he had various small wounds all over his body. The horseshoes were worn almost flat, and the hooves themselves were severely damaged. It was really hard to imagine how he had survived until now.

No wonder he ran to find Li Qi; he was at a dead end.

"He's hurt so badly. Not only are the injuries severe, but there is a type of qi inside his body preventing him from recovering naturally," Shen Shuibi said with a worried tone.

Li Qi also channeled divine qi to his eyes.

He could see that this old horse was emitting some mixed qi.

There was a faint dragon qi, just like what he had seen on the Azure Dragon of the East, though the difference in density was roughly that between pure ink and a single drop of ink diluted in the ocean—barely a trace. It was so far removed from the Azure Dragon's that it couldn't even be quantified.

Besides that, Li Qi could also see a redness on the scar on that thigh.

This red color had a sharp, eerie feeling.

Like the red color on Ba Kui's blade.

_Is it baleful qi?_

    The original idiom is 龙马精神 (Lóng mǎ jīng shén). It is a common phrase used to describe someone (often the elderly) who is full of vitality and enthusiastic spirit.

    Shen Shuibi is citing this because the idiom references the Longma (Dragon Horse), a legendary creature in Chinese mythology with a dragon's head and a horse's body. She is using the existence of this idiom as proof that dragons and horses are biologically related.
