# Chapter 6: Sneak Attack

Li Qi looked just like a Shaman, muttering incantations in a bizarre posture.

But it had to be said, doing this was actually effective!

Streams of water, coming from who knows where, began to merge into Li Qi's body.

The flow was like dripping water from melting winter icicles; it added up to no more than twenty milliliters, thin as a thread.

However, these trickles of water made Li Qi feel comfortable all over.

He felt his soul being cleansed and his body washed pure.

His abdomen, heart, limbs, and mind became like the banks of a flowing river, scoured by the gurgling water until all filth was washed away.

The flowing water also brought a bountiful aura of life, causing his body—which was not very strong due to a lack of meat in his diet—to gradually swell up.

Li Qi felt a burst of refreshment. He looked at his own body, but suddenly saw two progress bars.

<div class="rustic-frame">

Ritual Enhancement: 92%.

</div>

<div class="rustic-frame">

Ox Strength Art Progress: 100%.

</div>

He did not know why, but the learning progress for that divine will inheritance of the Ox Strength Art had suddenly filled up.

Perhaps it was a benefit from the sacrificial ceremony, but regardless, Li Qi's head buzzed with a loud boom. He had actually instantly mastered all the key points regarding the Ox Strength Art!

It really was memory appearing out of thin air, as if he had suddenly gained ten years of cultivation effort.

It was just like playing a game where one clicked on a skill book. Once the progress bar finished loading, one reached the peak of perfection immediately.

Could a divine will inheritance achieve this degree of effect?

However, looking at Sixth Uncle's condition, he absolutely did not have this result.

Why did he dare to be so certain? Because Sixth Uncle's Wave-Shattering Force was far inferior to his own, and according to Sixth Uncle himself, his Wave-Shattering Force had come from a divine will inheritance.

Sixth Uncle had also received a divine will inheritance, yet his Wave-Shattering Force was inferior to the results of Li Qi practicing on his own for two years.

Thus, it was clear that a divine will inheritance should not make a person instantly proficient.

But right now, for some unknown reason, he knew with absolute clarity in his heart that he had practiced the Ox Strength Art to the point of mastery!

"The effect of the progress bar? Once the bar is full, I learn it instantly?" he could not help but guess.

The sample size was still too small to be certain; it was also possible this was an effect of the sacrificial ceremony.

Nevertheless, he felt joy in his heart. He had gambled correctly this time!

He hurriedly got up, breaking into a trot to leave.

People would be chased out after the ceremony. He had snuck in, and although the defenses were not tight, there were night watchmen patrolling. He had to slip away quickly while no one was looking.

Passing through the streets and turning corners, he walked cautiously toward his home.

Rounding another bend, the shadow of a staff suddenly appeared before Li Qi's face.

He lacked experience and was suffering a sudden sneak attack. Although he reacted because he was being careful, he only managed to dodge halfway and was ruthlessly struck on the shoulder by the club!

There was a muffled thud, and the wooden club actually snapped in half. Li Qi grunted in pain as half his body went limp!

Moreover, that person did not hesitate and swung the club again!

Li Qi even sensed that there seemed to be someone behind him as well!

Half his body was numb with pain. He half-crouched on the ground, having almost lost the ability to resist.

This would be the only reaction for a normal person viciously struck by a club. If Li Qi hadn't reacted and dodged slightly, a blow like that to the head would definitely have caused instantaneous unconsciousness.

Even though he had practiced the Wave-Shattering Force and his body wasn't that fragile, the opponent's strength was inconceivably great. The club was clearly made from scrap ironwood used in shipbuilding; it was as hard as metal, yet it had snapped in a single strike!

But it wasn't over. In the darkness came another strike, the full-force swing of the club emitting a whistling wind sound as it rushed directly at Li Qi.

At the same time, Li Qi clearly saw two progress bars in the darkness, both displaying 'Attack'.

There really were two people!

Then, his body seemed to stop belonging to him.

His skin began to harden, becoming like tanned leather. Not only did it lose its elasticity, but even his sensory perception seemed to dull, to the point where he wouldn't feel it even if he pinched himself hard.

His muscles began to bulge, and a wave of heat rushed to his head!

Bang!

The club ruthlessly struck his body, but this time, only the club shattered.

As the blow landed, his body felt no pain. As the force surged in, Li Qi could not help but pant.

Two white columns sprayed from his nostrils as a massive amount of white gas released from his body, directly enveloping the attacker's torso and momentarily blinding him.

The power of the white columns was quite potent, the heat flow even scattering the leftover ash in the corner of the wall.

Li Qi suddenly felt incredibly strong, as if he could smash through a wall.

The Ox Strength Art activated. It was as if a barbaric ox had been stuffed inside his frame, and he expanded visibly to the naked eye.

Then came a punch!

The man holding the club in front of him, having just been blinded by the exhaled white gas, could not react in time. Completely defenseless, he was struck squarely by the fist.

A _crack_ was heard, and the man's eyes went wide!

There was no sophisticated machinery in this world, but if there were, he would definitely use one sentence to describe his current sensation—

It was like being slammed by a dump truck.

Fresh blood spilled wildly from his mouth, unstoppable. His vision went black, and his entire person was simply hammered apart!

While Li Qi threw this punch, the attack from the person behind him also arrived as scheduled.

Li Qi watched the opponent's 'Attack' progress bar fill up, but his body could not react in time. He could only helplessly wait for the attack to stab him.

With a _pu_ sound, it sounded like a dull knife scratching against tough leather armor.

That person froze.

This was a knife!

How could there be a person whom a knife couldn't stab to death?

No, wait... how did this person suddenly grow taller?

As for Li Qi, his stature suddenly shot up by a foot, and his entire volume expanded by a third.

Nostrils breathing white smoke, skin turning red—he was impressively a humanoid barbaric ox!

He grabbed the attacker and violently pinned him to the ground.

He had intended to control the opponent, but with a _bang_, the back of the man's head simply caved in. His legs kicked once, and he stopped breathing.

This left Li Qi stunned on the spot.

From the moment he was ambushed until now, less than two seconds had passed.

In less than two seconds, he had dealt with two enemies? And for one of them, he had even wanted to hold back, yet still crushed him to death in an instant.

"People from the Strong Force Gang... Before, I could only fight two of them, but now I take one out with a single hit, finishing off two in seconds?" Li Qi looked at his hands in disbelief.

He was already certain they were from the Strong Force Gang.

Among those who held a grudge against him, only the strength of the Strong Force Gang could smash a club made of ironwood.

He just didn't know how the Strong Force Gang knew it was him.

Although he had killed someone, he didn't feel there was anything wrong with it, nor did he feel any nausea or the like, as he had seen happen to others before.

After all, the Strong Force Gang members wanted to kill him first; he was forced to kill them in return. Even in a court of law, it would be self-defense, so what was there to feel nauseous about?

Compared to the killing, his attention was now focused more on himself.

The effect of the Ox Strength Art had greatly exceeded his expectations!

Truly worthy of being a spell art!

But now was not the time for surprise. He quickly grabbed the two corpses, one in each hand, and lifted them up. After a thought, he threw them into the water, then dove in himself. Relying on the Wave-Shattering Force, he swam to the bottom, dug into the silt, found rocks, and buried both men, weighing them down with stones to ensure they wouldn't float up. Then, he washed his body clean and cleared the scene of the crime.

While he was cleaning the scene, he suddenly felt a wave of chest tightness.

Paying attention to his body again, he saw that a progress bar for the Ox Strength Art had appeared on him.

<div class="rustic-frame">

"Ox Strength Art, Duration 95%."

</div>

Calculating the time, about ten minutes?

He immediately deactivated the Ox Strength Art, and his body shrank down like a deflated balloon.

Having adapted to that powerful strength, this made him feel somewhat uncomfortable. However, according to the explanation in his memories... the Ox Strength Art could be cast three times a day. If one time lasted ten minutes, that was extremely powerful.

"And... the third function of the progress bar has been found," he thought to himself.

The first was to check the status of things.

The second was that perhaps after the learning progress bar filled, one could achieve instant mastery.

The third was this: it could actually check the duration progress of his own spell arts!

With this thing, plus the Ox Strength Art, Li Qi clenched his fist.

Give him a little time, and in the future, he would no longer need to work as a boat tracker!
