# Chapter 79: Learning

"Don't panic, I'm not blaming you. It's just that I've heard some rumors recently," Li Qi said.

With that, he calmed Old Ma down while recounting his experiences over the past two days, placing special emphasis on the matter concerning the Song Kingdom's General.

After he finished his tale, Old Ma actually grew calm.

He whinnied twice.

Then, Shen Shuibi translated, "Old Ma says that wasn't him."

"Ah?" Li Qi was stunned.

---

Great Deer Kingdom, Li Prefecture, Yi County, at the home of Patriarch Wang.

Li Qi arrived here alone to proceed with the next phase of negotiations.

Li Qi coughed twice softly. "Ahem, it seems there was a misunderstanding. So, I suppose I won't need you to smear yourself with your own blood after all."

After saying this, Li Qi cast a glance at Old Madam Wang.

Did she know...

That Old Ma was not Lingering Shadow?

She had to know, right?

She was a Diviner, after all, even if she had not officially entered the nine ranks.

But Li Qi himself hadn't entered the ranks either.

Yet, he already knew that even an unranked Invocator possessed all sorts of peculiar divine abilities, so he didn't dare underestimate her in the slightest.

In contrast, the Martial Dao...

Aside from fighting, it didn't seem to have any other profound uses.

But it was formidable enough in its own right. The Ox Strength Art alone granted him a tremendous force of six thousand catties. Once a martial artist reached Rank Nine, they could easily lift boulders weighing over twenty thousand catties relying on their physical body alone. With the explosive burst of the Carp Stream Intent, that power could briefly be doubled or more.

One could only say that the two paths had different areas of focus. The Martial Dao truly was a path that purely pursued combat prowess, but the Invocator's path was different—combat strength was merely supplementary, while its most crucial aspect lay in its versatile functionality.

As for Diviners, Li Qi had long heard of them. This path lacked raw combat strength, but they possessed a vast array of bizarre spell arts. Because of this, Li Qi dared not look down on Old Madam Wang even a fraction.

Therefore, Li Qi spoke, "Old Madam, since I no longer require you to pay with your blood to erase Old Ma's karmic threads, may I exchange this compensation for something else?"

Upon hearing Li Qi's request, Old Madam Wang nodded instantly. She quickly replied, "But of course. Senior Brother, please raise any demands you may have. I shall do my utmost to fulfill them."

"It is nothing strange. I simply want to ask, how exactly did you pinpoint our location? Because of that little trick, I ended up getting deceived by you," Li Qi asked.

At the mention of her deception, the old woman instantly flew into a panic.

Broaching this topic, Li Qi's expression grew stern. "Forgive my bluntness, old timer, but I bear the mission from a Grand Invocator. If your explanation is unsatisfactory—while I may have resolved the conflict between the living and the dead and spared you from a malicious ghost's venomous hands—if you cannot give me a proper answer, I might just have to silence you permanently."

Hearing the title 'Grand Invocator,' the old woman's body noticeably stiffened.

For anyone originating from Shaman God Mountain, the oppressive weight carried by the words Grand Invocator and Grand Diviner was absolute and undeniable.

She bowed deeply at once. "This foolish woman deserves death... I concealed the truth earlier, I pray Senior Brother does not take offense..."

"I know you hid things, but everyone has their own difficulties, so I won’t press you about the past. I only want you to tell me how you tracked me down." Li Qi waved his hand, his expression appearing relaxed, but his eyes remained locked intensely onto Old Madam Wang.

Old Madam Wang turned solemn, fear plainly written across her face, and dropped straight to her knees. "Senior Brother, please perceive the truth clearly. Though I am a foolish woman, I absolutely would never dare to delay the affairs of a Grand Invocator. In truth... I never actually knew Senior Brother's whereabouts at all."

"Senior Brother's cultivation is profound, and my divination arts were completely unable to locate you, so... this foolish woman resorted to a clumsy method."

"It's not complicated, really. That gold... I merely applied a minor spell art to it. It holds the form but not the substance, and is completely useless for shifting blame. But I hoped that a fellow disciple from Shaman God Mountain, or someone else with a keen eye, might notice the gold carried a curse. When that time came, they would naturally come seeking answers at my door... I have already distributed thirty-five such gold pieces." Old Madam Wang confessed.

"As long as we saw someone arriving from the wilderness, someone capable of slaying beasts alone or exhibiting unusual traits, I would have my son hand them a piece..." The old woman touched her forehead to the floor, explaining with utmost caution.

Listening to this, Li Qi tilted his head back, speechless and choking on his own silence.

Damn it, he had underestimated the heroes of the world.

Who could have imagined that a blind old woman in a rustic little county town possessed such a masterful method of baiting fish?

However, it did make perfect sense.

His heart ached terribly...

That sliver of gold was worth a thousand copper coins.

"Then, how did you confirm my dragon colt, as well as my tracks? You were even able to answer questions about the military saber?" Li Qi pressed further.

"I wouldn't dare hide it from Senior Brother. While at Shaman God Mountain, I learned a method known as 'Flowers in a Mirror, Moon in the Water,' which allowed me to peek at Senior Brother from afar... I then noticed the military qi on the long saber, deduced a few things on my own, and bluffed you... I never expected to guess entirely right... As for the military saber, that was a factual matter, and the lore regarding the dragon colt Lingering Shadow was also true..." Old Madam Wang admitted.

Li Qi truly had no idea what to say to that.

He mentally noted the entire ordeal, treating it as a valuable learning experience.

Well then, a fall into the pit, a gain in your wit. He would just consider it a hard-learned lesson.

However, he had no intention of holding her accountable. He simply told Old Madam Wang, "...Let us leave it at that. I will leave this saber with you to erase its karmic threads. I am going to resolve the final matter for your family, and after that, the Wang family will be completely free of danger."

"Thank you, Senior Brother!" Old Madam Wang kowtowed repeatedly.

Li Qi didn't stop her. He left the long saber behind for her to cast her spell and went off to complete the final sacrificial ritual, offering the five preparations and the bright water so he could be rewarded with Yin qi.

The five preparations were five types of finely minced, cold meat dishes.

Bright water was water that had been blessed by an Invocator, nourished and warmed by the qi within the Invocator's own body.

He conducted the ritual, extracted the qi from the tomb while he was at it, received the blessing of the Ghostly God, and finally resealed the grave.

By the time all of this was completed, the karmic threads on the long saber had also been cleanly erased.

Li Qi didn't force Old Madam Wang to die, but he still accepted the twenty pieces of gold from the Wang family.

Afterward, he did not linger. He bought some travel supplies, mounted Old Ma, and rode off without stopping to rest.

On the road, Shen Shuibi wrapped her arms tightly around his waist to keep from falling off. Amidst Old Ma's lightning-fast sprint, she suddenly asked, "Li Qi, are we just letting this go? That doesn't really seem like you, does it?"

"How is it not like me?" Li Qi asked in return.

"Well, I just felt that to avoid any future risks, you would have silenced them permanently before leaving," Shen Shuibi remarked.

Hearing this, Li Qi burst into hearty laughter.

"If I were still the same me who had just stepped out of Li Prefecture City, then I definitely would have killed them without hesitation to eliminate any potential risk," Li Qi explained to Shen Shuibi.

"But things are different now." Li Qi's voice suddenly lowered.

"I am not an executioner, nor am I a desperate fugitive. I am now a seeker of the Dao. My goal is to scale the path of the Dao and behold grander landscapes, not to scurry about acting as timid and overly cautious as a rat!" Li Qi raised his head high, his tone brimming with absolute confidence.

"Oh, so you just feel that they aren't a threat to you, right?" Shen Shuibi replied, tilting her head.

"Ahem, when you put it that way, it makes me sound very..." Li Qi felt somewhat awkward. A rabbit's sharp intuition was always rather unpleasant at times like this.

"I'm not saying you're arrogant, oh." Shen Shuibi counted on her fingers. "Doesn't this just come down to following your true nature? You probably just don't want to kill people, so you'd rather bear a little risk instead, right?"
