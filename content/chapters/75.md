# Chapter 75: The Guest of Honor

It was broad daylight. The bright sun hung high in the sky, and the surroundings were brimming with vitality, carrying the warm aura of spring.

However, as Li Qi focused all his attention and surveyed the area, he unexpectedly felt a chill.

Amidst this abundant vitality, some kind of shadow was gathering.

Its momentum was like massive crashing waves or overlapping mountain peaks, surging forward menacingly.

Li Qi stood by the altar, holding up a wine goblet.

Then, as if a dragon were siphoning water, the wine inside the goblet began to swirl. It transformed into a fine thread, silently flying into the air before vanishing completely.

It looked as though it had been atmoized.

Following that, someone began to move their chopsticks over the sacrificial stands arranged on the ground altar.

It was invisible to the naked eye, but Li Qi could perceive it through qi. It was a spherical, chaotic, and bizarre existence lacking any specific form.

Was this... a ghost?

Li Qi continued the sacrificial rites. Upon seeing this scene, he sat down, took the pickled mallow with his right hand, dipped it in meat paste, and performed the sacrifice between the two stem-bowls. The assistant offered the broomcorn, foxtail millet, and sliced lungs to the 'corpse.'

"The flavor is quite delicious," a voice rang out beside Li Qi's ear.

Even the surrounding temperature plummeted significantly.

Li Qi did not reply. He knew this was just part of the sacrificial rite. He proceeded to move the bowls closer, shifted the bowl containing broomcorn onto the mat, placed the great broth and meat juices to the north of the meat paste, and lifted the lung and spine sections to offer to the 'corpse.'

At this moment, the master of the house, Patriarch Wang, was kowtowing repeatedly in the distance.

This was what Li Qi had instructed from the very beginning. According to the etiquette, the master needed to bow to the 'corpse' at this exact moment, and subsequently offer the sacrificial animals to it.

The 'corpse' took food three more times, then proclaimed to the master that it was full.

The Invocator urged the 'corpse' to eat more, offering the hind leg bone of a pig, the hind leg bone of a beast, and a fish to the 'corpse,' with the same etiquette as before.

The 'corpse' again took food three times and proclaimed to the master that it was full. The Invocator once more urged the 'corpse' to eat more, repeating the previous process.

Li Qi acted with trembling caution, strictly following the etiquette.

He knew that although the 'corpse' was the deceased, it was also not entirely them.

Here, the meaning of 'corpse' referred to the representative who received the sacrifices on behalf of the dead during the rite.

After a person died, their physical corpse was used as the spirit tablet. As the saying went: "The dead are the end; the corpse is the master. Thus, it is called the final master."

The 'corpse' currently receiving the sacrifice was, in fact, a combination of three elements: the sacrificial rite itself, the Invocator, and the ghost. Together, they formed a 'ghostly god' that manifested to represent the attitudes of all three parties.

If the sacrifice was completed smoothly, it meant the Invocator had successfully established communication with that 'ghost.'

Patriarch Wang kowtowed off to the side, every hair on his body standing on end, nearly wetting his pants in terror.

This was because he had witnessed with his own eyes, in broad daylight, some unknown entity feasting and drinking opposite the Invocator.

The surrounding temperature had dropped, and even the grass and trees looked somewhat withered.

The terrifying entity that had ruined his family and caused so much death was sitting right in front of him.

The intense fear made Patriarch Wang want to burst into tears.

However, the Invocator had repeatedly cautioned him beforehand to act exactly as instructed. Right now, all he had to do was stand obediently after finishing his kowtows. If he ruined the sacrificial ceremony...

Then he could just wait for death.

Therefore, even though tears were streaming down his face and his legs were trembling like a sifter, he kept his legs clamped tightly shut to stop himself from wetting his pants while remaining rooted to the spot.

While Li Qi was not quite as terrified, he remained highly vigilant in his heart.

He focused entirely on completing the sacrificial rites. It wasn't until thirty minutes later that all the complex ceremonies were finally concluded.

The final ritual of the sacrifice.

The Invocator removed the master's stands, stem-bowls, and bamboo vessels, relocating them beneath the eastern wall. Then, holding his own sacrificial stand, the Invocator stepped away from the altar and stood to the west of it, facing east.

The 'corpse' stood up, drank wine, draining the goblet in one gulp, and set it down.

Li Qi descended from the hall.

At this time, the Invocator needed to proclaim to the master: "The rite is complete."

Li Qi walked with measured, solemn steps toward the master, Patriarch Wang.

Patriarch Wang couldn't hold it in any longer and actually wet himself.

Because this step involved the 'corpse' standing up after finishing its meal, with the Invocator guiding it from the front, leading it straight toward the master.

Watching this unfold, Patriarch Wang finally lost his composure. He nearly collapsed to the ground, his face as white as a sheet of paper.

Though he managed to stay on his feet and avoid falling, he failed to control his lower half.

If he had only known... he wouldn't have had soup for breakfast this morning...

But right now, he had to hold on.

Li Qi walked up to Patriarch Wang with a solemn expression.

They were at the very end; they couldn't afford to waste all their previous efforts now.

The closer they got to the end, the more cautious they needed to be.

"The rite has concluded. I invite the master to see the 'corpse' off," Li Qi said.

Patriarch Wang stood frozen in place, making no movement whatsoever.

Anxious and frustrated, Li Qi circulated his internal qi and exhaled forcefully forward, glaring at the man.

The exhaled breath, empowered by his qi, struck Patriarch Wang's face with a crisp smack like an invisible slap, finally snapping the terrified man out of his daze.

Stumbling and scrambling, Patriarch Wang frantically dropped to his knees in the direction of the 'corpse' and bowed twice.

After receiving the master's two bows, the 'corpse' then returned a salute to the Invocator.

Following the salute, the 'corpse' spat out a goblet of wine out of thin air.

This was half of the wine that the 'corpse' had just drunk.

Li Qi solemnly took it and downed it in one gulp.

At the same time, Li Qi's vision went black.

The sacrificial rite was complete, and he had received an 'invitation.'

An invitation from the 'corpse.'

With darkness filling his vision, Li Qi only felt his divine soul being tugged by some mysterious power.

He knew the main event had arrived.

According to Li Qi's own understanding, sacrificial rites were essentially methods for communicating with ghosts and gods. By utilizing these techniques explored by their predecessors, they could accomplish unimaginable feats.

For example, it was like a chemistry experiment. You added different substances in sequence and performed a series of strange operations, such as wiping test tubes clean, twisting off bottle caps, and filling them with solutions.

These experimental sequences were similar to the various key steps within a sacrificial rite.

The only difference was that he did not understand the underlying principles behind these etiquette procedures, so he could only follow the instructions.

Perhaps when his cultivation grew higher, he would be able to analyze and unravel those underlying principles himself.

Getting back to the matter at hand, through the sacrifice, the Invocator, and the ghost itself, the three elements combined to form a 'corpse' to receive the rites. The existence of the 'corpse' represented the harmony and balance of all three parties.

If a mistake occurred during the sacrifice, or if the Invocator was unwilling, or if the ghost was unwilling—should any of these three situations arise, it would lead to the collapse of the 'corpse' and the failure of communication.

But if the sacrifice was completed, it meant that the ghost and the Invocator could begin communicating through the channel of the sacrificial rite.

Drinking the wine spat out by the 'corpse' at this moment was the proof that the Invocator accepted the communication.

Thus, after drinking this goblet of wine, Li Qi's divine soul was instantly drawn in by the sacrificial rite. At the very same time, the ghost's soul was also drawn in!

The two of them would communicate within the special environment constructed by the sacrifice!

This was the most famous ability of an Invocator.

Using sacrifices as a means to communicate with Heavenly Gods, Earthly Divinities, and Human Ghosts!

When light finally returned to Li Qi's vision, he realized that he had arrived in a bizarre black space. Surrounding him were the candles lit during the previous sacrificial rites, illuminating the darkness.

Before him hovered a mass of chaotic qi!
