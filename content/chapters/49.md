# Chapter 49: Arrival

Mountain root earth qi was precisely the earth qi of this very mountain.

Earth qi possessed its own unique properties.

As the old saying went: "There is a great tree named You; its jade-green leaves thrive even in winter, its fruit is crimson, and its taste is sour. Consuming its bark and juice cures ailments of qi reversal. The people of Qi Prefecture treasure it, yet if carried north across the Huai River, it transforms into the bitter Zhi. The mynah bird will not cross the Ji River, and the badger will die if it crosses the Wen River; this is all due to the nature of the earth qi."[^1]

Earth qi possessed inherent properties. The earth qi varied from place to place, resulting in different local characteristics, which in turn gave rise to different circumstances and customs.

Li Qi used to think this was all utter nonsense, but after careful consideration, he had to admit that it was incredibly accurate.

In the world he originally came from, the idea that an orange grown south of the Huai River was an orange, while one grown north of it became a bitter orange, was pure nonsense—they were simply different varieties. However, in this world, such things genuinely existed.

Furthermore, in that other world, the differing temperatures across various regions were due to the existence of latitudes. Because his home planet was round, sunlight fell upon it at different angles.

But in this world, the earth was flat.

Under good lighting conditions, standing atop a hillock, he could gaze for dozens of miles without ever seeing such a thing as a horizon.

It was evident that the concepts of longitude and latitude simply did not exist here.

This was a world of a round heaven and a square earth.[^2] 
Therefore, the only things capable of determining the nature of different regions were naturally the ethereal, intangible earth qi and heavenly qi.

Li Qi had realized many times over that this world was entirely different from the one he once knew.

Of course, there were some commonalities, but the underlying mechanics were undoubtedly different. For instance, the gravitational pull here was absolutely not the same thing as in his old world; otherwise, the flat earth would have collapsed in on itself long ago.

Given this, he wholly believed the descriptions of mountain root earth qi written in the Book of Invocation.

Why could a mountain be called a mountain?

What was the difference between a mountain and a mere pile of dirt and rocks heaped upon the ground?

The difference was that a mountain possessed a root. A mountain might simply appear to be a towering mound of stone and earth, but in reality, beneath the mountain, buried beneath the surface of the earth, lay an inverted mountain. It was perhaps even deeper and sturdier than the mountain above.

This was the mountain root, the foundation that allowed the great mountain to stand tall for ten thousand years without falling.

If a mountain had no root, it would topple with a single push. How could it stand firm?

The nature of the mountain root was derived from the surrounding terrain.

If the mountain root had bubbling springs forming streams, meaning it was the source of water, then it was a configuration of harmonized water and soil.

If the mountain root possessed a stone skeleton, then trees would grow wild and unruly, brimming with vibrant vitality.

If a river chewed at the mountain root from below, it would be an earthen hill devoid of trees and prominent rocks, a small mountain reaching no more than several dozen meters in height.

Legends told of a mountain in Penglai whose mountain root naturally formed jade palaces, draped in the colorful illusions of mirages, manifesting as a worldly marvel of extraordinary wonder.

These were all manifestations of the mountain root's nature.

And Li Qi, as an Invocator specializing in Earthly Divinities, possessed a unique method for utilizing this mountain root earth qi.

That was to use it in conjunction with heavenly qi.

The Book of Invocation stated: "Earth qi ascends, heavenly qi descends, yin and yang rub against one another, heaven and earth agitate each other, drummed by thunder and lightning, roused by wind and rain!"

Earth qi rose to become clouds, heavenly qi fell to become rain; when clouds and rain harmonized, lightning was born!

Invocators were renowned for their combat prowess.

Back when Shen Shuibi, that rabbit, first met Li Qi, her assessment had been: "Those who serve ghosts and gods are known as Invocators. They have ghosts and gods protecting them, ancestral heroic spirits following them, Heavenly Gods and Earthly Divinities, and the myriad gods of the four directions all sheltering them; their might is terrifying."[^3]

As for Shen Shuibi, although it was unknown what Dao path she belonged to, it was known that she was at Rank 5.

It was just that Li Qi was still a total novice right now. He only had a few wisps of qi and did not even possess a rank.

But this did not mean he couldn't utilize his knowledge and planning to try and scheme to secure a trump card for himself.

The Azure Dragon's divine qi bestowed by the Azure Dragon of the East was a type of heavenly qi, but the Earthly Divinities he sacrificed to—the inner door gods, Shentu and Yulei—did not grant earth qi.

The five household gods were Earthly Divinities, but what they granted was divine qi, not earth qi.

Therefore, at this moment, he was preparing to use his own Qi, as well as the disgust of this local mountain god towards him, to exchange for a wisp of earth qi.

The sacrificial ritual continued.

The mountain spirit sensed that its innate purity had been defiled by the aura of a human.

This left the originally pure mountain spirit endlessly enraged, but this sliver of defilement was too utterly insignificant to it; thus, it effortlessly dispersed Li Qi's Qi and retracted its own power.

Meanwhile, Li Qi felt an indescribable pressure...

The surrounding mountain forests... seemed to dislike him quite a bit?

There was a feeling of being rejected by the entire world.

_No wonder it's said that this method cannot be used recklessly... this counts as interfering with this mountain spirit's Dao path. If it has good luck in the future and can transform into a god, it might just come running over to cause trouble for me..._ Li Qi mocked himself.

Human Qi polluting the mountain spirit meant that if it wanted to achieve godhood in the future, its path would be much more arduous than that of an ordinary mountain spirit.

The unthinking and unfeeling mountain spirit's current disgust would not have any substantial effect, so Li Qi was not worried about anything. As for the future?

What a joke. There were billions upon billions of mountains and rivers in this world. How many could actually transform into gods?

Winning the lottery had higher odds than that.

"This side is ready... I'll just leave this altar here." Li Qi raised his head and looked at the altar piled high with stones.

This altar was built entirely out of stacked stones. He had specifically run a stress analysis; with each stone weighing two to three hundred catties, it added up to over ten thousand catties in total—around ten tons of rock.

Hauling it all up on his back had truly not been easy.

Having finished his own tasks, Li Qi turned his head and glanced at Old Ma and Shen Shuibi.

These two non-humans fared even worse than Li Qi. They had already collapsed from exhaustion and fallen asleep on the side. Old Ma was sleeping half-kneeling against a tree, and Shen Shuibi was sleeping leaning against Old Ma; both were completely out cold.

_How truly carefree..._

It was just that Li Qi didn't dare to be so carefree.

_I won't sleep tonight, then._

He found a high vantage point overlooking the surroundings and sat down.

And continued reading.

It was already at 0.8%. Reading diligently every day without pausing would eventually yield results.

Wasn't today's trump card obtained entirely through reading?

In the future, he might even be like Shen Shuibi, speaking in polished literary prose, casually spouting various allusions and ancient texts.

As a former researcher, Li Qi was profoundly aware that 'knowledge is power.'

While reading, Li Qi split his attention to observe the outside.

However, before he could spot anything amiss in the distance, he instead saw Shen Shuibi's ears suddenly pop out from her head.

It was those rabbit ears.

_Adorable._

But before Li Qi could react, Shen Shuibi suddenly opened her eyes, her face filled with panic. "Hoofbeats! Something is coming! A lot of hoofbeats, at least ten!"

Hearing this, Li Qi stood up immediately.

_Damn it, that divination art was truly accurate._

[^1]: This passage is a play on a famous classical Chinese idiom from the _Annals of Master Yan (Yanzi Chunqiu)_: "Oranges grown south of the Huai River are oranges; grown north, they become bitter oranges". _You_ -> Pomelo & _Zhi_ -> Bitter Orange.

    This passage also quotes the ancient text Record of Trades (_Kao Gong Ji_). It describes real ecological boundaries observed in ancient China. The Ji and Wen rivers acted as stark climatic borders. The mynah, a warm-climate bird, would freeze north of the Ji River. The badger (or raccoon dog) would starve or freeze north of the Wen River due to sudden changes in vegetation and soil. Ancient scholars attributed these abrupt, invisible habitat borders to the area's specific "earth qi."
