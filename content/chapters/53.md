# Chapter 53: Sneak Attack

Li Qi's entire body was paralyzed, his heartbeat was erratic, his limbs were freezing, and he even felt a blockage in his lungs.

Furthermore, he was beginning to suffocate.

Under normal circumstances, it would take a very long time for him to suffocate underwater.

But earlier, in order to blast that officer, he had expelled all the air from his lungs.

An underwater battle already consumed immense stamina, and after venting all his reserved breath, his respiration was truly stalled, and suffocation had set in.

The military qi and baleful qi had destroyed the circulation of his nutritive qi and defensive qi, throwing his internal functions into chaos.

No matter how exhaustively he had calculated before the fight began, it was ultimately impossible for him to predict everything without prior intelligence.

However, although he had not anticipated this man knowing sword control techniques, this kind of injury was still within his expectations!

Old Ma had nearly died from baleful qi invading his body; how could he possibly fail to consider that?

And how had Old Ma resolved it?

He relied on his Great Forest Wood qi!

The Great Forest Wood qi from the Azure Dragon's divine qi!

"The twelve meridians correspond to the twelve months. The twelve months are divided into four seasons. The four seasons are spring, autumn, winter, and summer, each possessing a different qi; when nutritive and defensive qi follow one another, Yin and Yang harmonize, and the pure and turbid do not interfere, this follows the natural order and maintains health."

Heaven and earth possessed the four seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, each with distinctly different climatic traits, and the human body naturally adapted to them. Nutritive qi and defensive qi also possessed four phases. As long as the internal and external remained synchronized, their circulation orderly, Yin and Yang mutually coordinated, and the pure and turbid qi did not clash, one's personal cosmos could conform to the changes of the greater external world, keeping the meridians functioning normally.

When Shen Shuibi had explained these concepts, Li Qi had explicitly sought her out to ask.

And Shen Shuibi, despite looking utterly naive now, was once a Rank 5 expert who even possessed an Unsullied Body, having spent years accompanying a powerhouse like Lady Luofu.

Li Qi placed tremendous trust in her words.

It was currently springtime, and the Great Forest Wood qi was perfectly aligned with the season's nature. Against a mere wisp of baleful qi, how could it possibly claim his life?

Yet, it appeared he had not mobilized any of it.

He remained lying rigidly in the water, the air in his lungs utterly depleted as he teetered on the brink of suffocation, his face turning a bruised, suffocated purple.

At first glance, he looked exactly like a floating corpse.

The officer swam forward, preparing to deliver the finishing blow.

But he was very cautious, only moving slightly closer before controlling his long saber to thrust at Li Qi's floating corpse from a distance.

He was not a fool; how could he possibly risk getting close to stab him personally?

Under his control, the blade shot rapidly toward Li Qi.

Then, at this precise moment, Li Qi—who was still playing dead—suddenly opened his eyes!

He looked completely fine, because he had long since unleashed all of his Great Forest Wood qi, keeping only a single wisp in reserve while flooding his body with everything else he had, purging the baleful qi without a single trace remaining.

In fact, under the scouring of so much Great Forest Wood qi, all his external wounds had completely healed, and even some hidden ailments were cured by the potent regenerative power.

Then, without pausing for even a second, Li Qi untied a rope from his waist.

No, it was not a rope.

It was a willow branch!

Li Qi gritted his teeth! _You have a weapon, but you think I don't?!_

He simply did not know how to use a whip. Had he drawn it earlier, he likely would have been made a fool of by the opponent's crisp blade work.

Only now, while he played dead and the opponent dropped his guard, did he have a chance to land a hit!

Li Qi flung the willow branch out, lashing it forward fiercely to entangle the long saber.

"Ugh-ahhh!" The officer suddenly let out an agonizing howl and clutched his eyes. Even underwater, he could not suppress his scream, instantly spewing out all the stored air in his lungs.

The divine soul attached to his long saber had been lashed apart!

Dwelling within the willow branch was the divine qi of the inner door gods, Shentu and Yulei, two Earthly Divinities!

It specialized in striking ghosts and possessed an awe-inspiring suppressive effect on divine souls!

Moreover, the willow branch itself was an aggregation of Yin qi, granting it a tremendous boost against Yin souls.

With these two traits stacked together, it was like a tiger growing wings!

With one lash of the willow branch, it wrapped around the blade while simultaneously shattering the divine soul resting upon it.

Having his divine soul lashed apart felt like someone smashing a sledgehammer into the bridge of his nose. The officer suffered unbearable head trauma and promptly inhaled a lungful of water!

He never could have imagined that this Invocator actually had a dharma artifact in his hands!

A genuine dharma artifact, one bestowed by a true Grand Invocator of Shaman God Mountain!

This was absolutely not something a mere Squad Leader could clash with head-on!

The results of this sneak attack were astonishingly effective, and even Li Qi hadn't expected it to instantly strip the man of his combat ability. Bleeding from his seven orifices, the officer convulsed endlessly in the water as if struck by lightning.

But Li Qi did not hesitate in the slightest. Snatching up the man's long saber, he plunged it straight into his body!

One thrust wasn't enough, so he immediately pulled it out and stabbed four or five times in rapid succession.

Still unsatisfied, he thrust the blade directly into his throat and twisted it in a full circle.

He had to admit, this blade was truly peerlessly sharp.

In passing, he yanked the scabbard free, hefted the opponent's corpse onto his shoulder, held his final breath, and hurriedly swam to the surface.

Surfacing was not for any other reason but to use a meat shield!

It completely lacked any heroic aura or valiant passion.

But it ensured survival.

Just as expected, the moment he surfaced and gasped for air, the whistling of crossbow bolts rang out, burying themselves straight into the officer's corpse.

"Squad Leader!" the other soldiers roared in furious unison, their eyes practically splitting at the seams!

But Li Qi couldn't be bothered with these men. Taking advantage of them reloading their crossbows, he discarded the corpse, gripped the saber, and darted swiftly toward the river mouth.

The eyes of the soldiers guarding the river mouth had turned entirely red, and they all gripped their long sabers, forming a tight defensive line!

This bastard had killed the commanding officer of their squad. If they didn't slaughter him to avenge their Squad Leader, they would live with shame for the rest of their lives!

But Li Qi was already prepared, and at this very moment, he activated the trump card he had racked his brains to set up earlier.

The heavenly qi Li Qi had accumulated, alongside the trace of earth qi he had obtained through trickery, were now fused together.

Earth qi ascends, heavenly qi descends; Yin and Yang grind against each other, heaven and earth agitate, and from this friction, thunder and lightning are drummed forth.

The sudden clap of thunder sent shockwaves shooting out—stirring the essence of spring, driving away cunning beasts, frightening tigers and leopards, and terrifying birds of prey. Where the thunder struck, nothing remained unbroken!

The union of heavenly qi and earth qi birthed the qi of thunder!

This single thread of thunder qi was ignited, transforming into spring thunder that exploded with a deafening boom!

With a thunderous crash, the soldiers standing at the river mouth were instantly paralyzed.

Could this wisp of thunder qi kill these men?

To be honest, Li Qi found it unlikely, as the opponents were no pushovers; each of them was a cultivator, and they might even possess formal ranks!

Just like that officer. If he hadn't used the willow branch combined with his calculations to scheme against him, and if he hadn't held the geographical advantage of fighting underwater, he never would have eked out a victory. If they were on the shore, the opponent probably would have hacked him to death in a single strike.

Therefore, this rather weak bolt of lightning most likely wouldn't strike them dead.

However, these men were wearing metal armor and standing in the water.

It might not kill them, but locking their bodies into paralysis was entirely achievable!

Seizing the moment of their paralysis, Li Qi swiftly broke through the river mouth and swam away in a flash!

Riding the current downstream, these men would never catch up! They would have to go back and mount their horses!
