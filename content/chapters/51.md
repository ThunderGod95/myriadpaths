# Chapter 51: Clash

The crossbow bolt screamed through the air, hurtling straight toward Li Qi!

The razor-sharp quarrel carried a chilling, murderous intent. The officer hadn't bothered uttering another word; he fully intended to execute Li Qi on the spot!

Fortunately, Li Qi had been hyper-vigilant. The moment the officer reached for his weapon, Li Qi threw himself into a crouching tiger stance and dove flat onto the ground. The bolt zipped through the space he had occupied a fraction of a second prior, shattering the rock behind him before embedding itself deeply into the stone!

Li Qi's scalp went numb!

_Dammit! They didn't even care to waste two words on me before going for the kill!_

These bastards really were no better than armed bandits!

Li Qi abandoned any further attempts at parley. Still sprawled on the ground, a dozen tactical plans flashed through his mind. With a vicious heave, he hurled the rock in his hand high up the mountain!

The mountain was small, barely a few dozen zhang in height.

At its peak sat the altar Li Qi had erected earlier.

The thrown rock arced through the air and smashed directly into the precarious altar perched on the upper cliff edge.

Simultaneously, Li Qi channeled his inner power. His physique swelled by a full foot as he activated the Ox Strength Art!

Seeing this, the officer's eyes widened in shock.

"The Ox Strength Art!" he bellowed. "On guard! This bastard is an Invocator from Shaman God Mountain!"

The other nine soldiers burst into motion!

The mountainous terrain made a cavalry charge impossible; the steeds would have to constantly jump or dodge obstacles. Hearing the command, the men dismounted instantly, drew their hand crossbows, and unleashed a volley of bolts with a series of deadly thwips.

Discarding all dignity, Li Qi wildly rolled across the dirt. By using the cover of darkness and the scattered boulders, he miraculously managed to evade the deadly fusillade.

The bolts buried themselves deeply into the earth. Had they struck flesh, even Li Qi's toughened hide would have been pierced through, resulting in instant, crippling injuries.

Realizing they had missed and that reloading would take precious seconds, several soldiers discarded their crossbows. Drawing their long sabers, they moved to flank Li Qi, intent on hacking him to pieces!

But at that exact moment, a low, rumbling roar echoed from above.

The soldiers snapped their heads up.

They watched in horror as countless boulders plummeted from the cliff face!

The altar—a structure deliberately stacked based on Li Qi's structural stress analysis to be extremely top-heavy and unstable—had completely collapsed from the impact of his thrown rock. Tens of thousands of pounds of stone came crashing down in a terrifying avalanche!

When tens of thousands of pounds of rock fell from a height of dozens of zhang, the resulting force multiplied exponentially.

The kinetic impact of the avalanche was magnified dozens of times over!

Panic erupted among the soldiers as they scrambled backward to retreat!

However, Li Qi, his eyes locked onto his progress bar, seized the fleeting window of opportunity. Ignoring the rain of death above, he charged headlong into the fray!

He slammed shoulder-first into a retreating soldier, secured an iron grip on him, and hoisted the armored man entirely off the ground!

Empowered by the Ox Strength Art, Li Qi wielded a monstrous physical force of six thousand eight hundred pounds. These soldiers, elite as they were, couldn't hope to match his raw physical might!

Under normal circumstances, brute strength alone would not have been enough to defeat them. But in this chaotic moment—blinded by the falling rocks and desperate to retreat—Li Qi had used his progress bar vision to exploit their disrupted movements, catching one completely off-balance and lifting him high!

Li Qi hurled the flailing soldier violently into a shadowed depression on the ground. Then, shielding his head with his arms, he scrambled and rolled desperately toward the relative safety of a mountain trench as the rockslide crashed down around him.

His suicidal charge into the avalanche had successfully anchored one of the enemy soldiers to the kill zone!

Though Li Qi took several hits from flying shrapnel, opening up bleeding gashes, the rejuvenating effects of his Great Forest Wood qi had already begun stitching the wounds closed.

The soldier Li Qi had smashed into the ground struggled to rise under the weight of his heavy armor. A falling boulder struck him, drawing a piteous howl, though he clung stubbornly to life.

His comrades rushed to save him, but less than half a second later, the shower of smaller pebbles gave way to the massive core boulders. The colossal stones slammed down one after another, burying the fallen soldier completely.

A few muffled shrieks echoed briefly, but they were quickly drowned out by the deafening thunder of stone impacting earth.

The altar hadn't consisted of an overwhelming amount of stone. The rockslide lasted less than five seconds, but it was enough to crush one of the elite soldiers to a bloody pulp.

"Kill that bastard!" the officer roared in absolute fury, thrusting his long saber toward Li Qi!

"Hah!" the remaining soldiers bellowed in unison, preparing to vault over the rubble and charge.

But Li Qi wasn't going to stick around to accommodate them. While the rockslide had momentarily stalled their advance, he was already sprinting away for dear life.

By the time the soldiers bypassed the debris to give chase, he had reached the mountain pool.

It was an ordinary mountain ravine pool, dozens of meters deep, fed by a waterfall converging from several smaller streams. The pool flowed out into a fast-moving river that led further downstream.

Without a shred of hesitation, Li Qi plunged into the deep water.

"To the river mouth! Cut him off!" the officer barked instantly.

The seasoned officer had parsed the tactical situation in a split second.

The bastard had clearly jumped into the pool, believing that their heavy armor would prevent them from giving chase, in hopes of escaping via the current.

And it was a sound calculation. Their armor was immensely heavy and restricted mobility. Diving into deep water while fully armored was practically a guarantee of drowning.

After a cursory sweep of the surrounding terrain, the officer decisively opted to corner his prey. Between the deep pool and the flowing river mouth, there were bound to be shallows!

As areas formed by sediment carried by the current, these shallows would be elevated, meaning the water there would be relatively shallow.

By stationing four or five men at the shallows, the bastard would be entirely trapped within the confines of the small pool!

If he dared surface, they would shoot him full of bolts.

If he refused to surface, he would simply drown.

To think they would stumble upon an Invocator from Shaman God Mountain out here.

Slaying him would be another first-class military merit!

The Invocators of Shaman God Mountain had inflicted catastrophic casualties upon their forces on the Songtang battlefield.

"Five of you, seal off the shallows! The rest, grab your crossbows and surround the pool! The moment he shows his face, shoot him dead!" the officer commanded loudly.

The soldiers executed the orders with alarming speed. Five heavily armored men seized the shallows. The water here barely reached their waists—far too shallow to drown in. They stood firmly in the current, long sabers gripped tightly in both hands. If Li Qi tried to break through the river mouth, they would dice him to pieces.

The remaining three sprinted back to retrieve their dropped crossbows. They rapidly nocked fresh quarrels and formed a perimeter around the small pool, aiming down at the dark water.

The instant Li Qi breached the surface, they would fire.

With nowhere to dodge in the water, a single hit would spell instant death!

Meanwhile, the commanding officer had used this brief window to strip off his heavy armor.

"Be wary of his spell arts! Invocators revere different ghosts and gods, giving them diverse abilities. This man possesses the Ox Strength Art; he is no mere rustic Spirit Medium, but an orthodox Invocator of Shaman God Mountain. He must have other tricks up his sleeve. We cannot let him linger in the deep. I am going in to flush him out."

"Be careful, Squad Leader! The man possesses boundless strength!" a soldier warned.

"That is the Ox Strength Art, borrowing the power of the Earthly Divinity Qiong Ox," the officer retorted immediately. "It proves he undoubtedly belongs to the Earthly Divinity lineage. That lineage excels in weaponizing the very mountains and rivers—the rockslide was proof enough of his capability. We must not give him time to prepare; we must take the initiative and strike."

His reasoning was sound and his logic flawless. With no arguments to mount, the men simply followed his orders.

"There's no need to worry. The Qi of Four Seasons within his body remains undifferentiated. He is clearly unranked. I am a Rank Nine practitioner of the Military lineage; do you think I have anything to fear from him?" Leaving those final words hanging in the air, the fully unarmored officer prepared to dive.
