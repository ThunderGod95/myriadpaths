# Chapter 61: Plans

Shen Shuibi rested in a clearing amidst the trees.

"Doo-doo-doo~, lu-lu-lu~." She hummed an unfamiliar tune, tidying up the various pelts and beast bones in her wicker basket while breathing in and exhaling the Supreme Yin qi.

It was roughly akin to snacking.

The moon was Supreme Yin, and whenever it hung high in the sky, it naturally emitted Supreme Yin qi, blanketing the firmament and blessing the world below.

Within the cultivation of demons, Supreme Yin was an incredibly vital component; they almost universally required the respiration of Supreme Yin qi to advance their cultivation.

Yet for Shen Shuibi, this only counted as a casual treat.

She did not cultivate demonic arts, but rather an orthodox cultivation method of a profound tradition. Luofu Mountain was one of the Daoist sects' ten great grotto-heavens, and though she was a demon, she was a natural-born anomaly of heaven and earth, meaning even the most vehemently anti-demon exorcists would not raise a hand against her.

Rather than being called a demon beast, her kind were generally referred to as spirit beasts, or even immortal beasts, revered as omens of good fortune.

Furthermore, she possessed the Unsullied Body; she was untainted by mortal dust, immune to both bitter cold and scorching heat, and impervious to all poisons. She required no mortal sustenance, dining on the wind and sipping the dew, surviving purely by inhaling the naturally occurring qi between heaven and earth.

Though she was a rabbit, she was far from ordinary.

"Hmm, he should be back soon, right? We can probably set off today? I think we're heading to Yi County?" Shen Shuibi pondered aloud as she organized the luggage.

Seventeen days had elapsed since the day Li Qi lost consciousness.

Over these seventeen days, Shen Shuibi had watched Li Qi train relentlessly every day while they waited for Old Ma's injuries to heal.

Once the baleful qi had been purged, Old Ma's recovery had progressed rapidly with the aid of the Great Forest Wood qi.

A few days ago, his movements were completely unhindered, but Li Qi stubbornly insisted on waiting until he was fully healed before leaving.

According to Li Qi's logic, sharpening the blade did not delay the woodcutting. Once they were fully prepared, they would follow the main road to Yi County, restock their dry rations and supplies, and then ride directly toward Lady Luofu's location.

With Old Ma there, they could cover eight hundred li a day; even a journey of ten thousand li would only take a dozen days.

Ten thousand li was enough to leave the Great Deer Kingdom entirely, so after a month or two of trekking at most, they would definitely find Her Ladyship!

That was exponentially faster than running on their own two legs.

The mere thought filled Shen Shuibi with glee, causing her to hum happily once more.

She was going to see Her Ladyship so soon!

Riding Old Ma and carrying the goat on his back, Li Qi hurried back to his temporary little camp.

Shen Shuibi remained exactly the same, practically unchanged. When her mouth was shut, she exuded an ethereal, otherworldly grace; the moment she spoke, she radiated a silly, endearing air. Yet, she would occasionally utter profound verses, possessing the refined elegance of a well-read scholar.

It was quite a contradiction.

Li Qi tossed the goat onto the ground, greeted Shen Shuibi, and immediately set to work skinning and butchering the carcass.

The rice cakes had long since run out, so Li Qi had been surviving on meat these past few days. He went hunting daily with Old Ma's assistance, and if he failed to catch anything, he went fishing instead.

He hadn't dared to do this before because his martial prowess was lacking and he wasn't particularly fast. If he wandered off the main road and encountered danger, he wouldn't even be able to outrun it.

One shouldn't assume that just because Li Qi possessed the Carp Stream Intent, catching and fishing was a simple affair.

There were far more things in the water than just fish.

If he dove under and ran into a water monkey staring him down, he might as well wait for death.

As someone who cherished his own life, Li Qi absolutely refused to take any risks before he was confident. Even when searching for a water source, he never strayed more than a mile from the main road.

However, ever since he had grasped the basics of the Carp Stream Intent and Old Ma's injuries had healed, he had grown noticeably bolder, daring to venture deeper into the woods and proactively hunting and fishing.

After all, even if he encountered danger, he could still run away if he couldn't win. How many wild beasts could outrun Old Ma? He was a dragon colt!

Besides this factor, there was another reason: he had completely exhausted his dry rations.

If he didn't hunt, he would starve to death.

The silver lining was that his progression in the Carp Stream Intent had skyrocketed ever since he started incorporating meat and fish into his diet.

In the Martial Dao, perseverance came first, followed closely by resources—the reputation was entirely well-deserved.

Someone who ate meat every day would improve vastly faster than others.

Over these past few days, Li Qi had stockpiled some pelts and beast bones; the meat was gone, but the skin and bones could still be sold for some coin.

He had originally planned to forage for some mountain goods to sell, but while he did manage to find wood ear mushrooms and the like...

He didn't know how to preserve them.

He had attempted to sun-dry the mushrooms to make dried wood ears.

But they quickly rotted away.

Lacking the required craftsmanship, he decided to abandon the idea; foraging just enough to eat each day to spice up his meals was sufficient.

As for regular mushrooms or shiitake, he didn't dare pick them at all.

He couldn't identify them, so what if he ate a poisonous one and died? The lands of Baiyue and the Hundred Thousand Mountains were indeed rich in mountain delicacies like mushrooms, but there were countless varieties. Unless one was a veteran mountaineer, an ordinary person foraging for food here would be digging their own grave.

Li Qi certainly didn't want to see little people dancing before his eyes after finishing a meal.

Having finished skinning and butchering, Li Qi rinsed the offal in the river. After ten minutes of washing, the foul odor dissipated. As for the meat, it was ready to be thrown into the pot to boil.

Fortunately, he had stocked up on enough coarse salt and other wild mountain spices to ensure the stew wasn't too unpalatable.

He boiled a portion in the iron pot and skewered another portion on branches to roast over the fire; it would be ready to eat in no time.

A single goat, after being deboned and bled, yielded around sixty to seventy catties of meat, enough to feed Li Qi for two whole days.

There was no helping it; his appetite had multiplied several times over since he began cultivating the Martial Dao.

Old Ma also received a cut of meat. Although horses were herbivores, they would occasionally consume meat to supplement their protein. Li Qi knew that some important figures normally fed their horses bird eggs and the like. As long as they didn't overeat, it wasn't a problem and even added to their nutrition.

Old Ma was well aware of this; he gobbled up the piece of meat and happily trotted off to forage on his own.

The Hundred Thousand Mountains were covered in lush grass, so there was no fear of going hungry.

Even though he was old in years, he remained brimming with boundless vitality now that his wounds were healed!

As Li Qi fussed over the food, Shen Shuibi leaned in close and asked cheerfully, "Li Qi, are we leaving after tonight?"

"Yeah, just as we planned. We'll head to Yi County first, sell off these pelts, bones, and fresh mountain goods, then buy some dry rations and travel gear. After we grab a change of clothes, we can ride into the Jianghu, and search for Lady Luofu along the way," Li Qi said with a smile.

"Searching for Her Ladyship is not something we're doing 'along the way'!" Shen Shuibi angrily waved her fists in the air.

Although she was usually gentle and even a bit timid, she never pulled her punches when the matter concerned Lady Luofu.

It was perfectly normal, and Li Qi completely understood.

To avoid exposing Lady Luofu, she had directly crippled her own cultivation base.

For a grand Rank Five expert to willingly go to such lengths was a testament to the sheer depth of their bond.

"I'm just joking, just joking." Li Qi raised his head, focused on the roasting meat, and fell silent.

A profound quiet settled over the camp.

_Was he truly joking?_

In reality, he wasn't. He was probing her.

Li Qi was the type of person who looked ten steps ahead before taking a single stride.

He was already contemplating what would happen after they found Lady Luofu.

Once she was found... Shen Shuibi would inevitably leave his side to reunite with Lady Luofu.

When that time came, what would he do?
