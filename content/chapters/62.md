# Chapter 62: Entering the City

In short, Li Qi thought a great deal that night.

Besides contemplating his future prospects, he also thought about the squad of soldiers he had encountered previously.

What was the deal with that squad of soldiers?

Were they soldiers of the Tang Empire?

But their banner had clearly depicted a pine tree with twisted roots and gnarled branches, resembling the flag of the Song Kingdom.

The Li River of the Great Deer Kingdom, after flowing for ten thousand li, split into two rivers. One merged into the vast ocean, and the other ultimately flowed into the Song Kingdom.

The known intelligence was that the Song Kingdom had fought a war with the Tang Empire and lost miserably.

This was hardly surprising. According to Li Qi's current understanding, the Tang Empire was actually on par with Shaman God Mountain.

The actual domain of Shaman God Mountain encompassed the entire southwestern portion of the world, including the Hundred Thousand Mountains. It was a major, top-ranking power; the Hundred Thousand Mountains only made up a third of Shaman God Mountain's territory, while regions further west like Annan, Houli, and even Shaman God Mountain itself boasted far vaster areas.

Though called a kingdom, compared to the Tang Empire, the Song Kingdom was roughly equivalent to a single Tang county. Losing the war was nothing out of the ordinary.

Therefore... could it be assumed that the current Song Kingdom was actually under the control of the Tang Empire? And by using it as a central hub to spread its influence toward the Shaman Dao factions, had this caused the surrounding Great Deer Kingdom to gradually lean toward the Human Dao?

In that case, as an Invocator of Shaman God Mountain, staying in this place seemed incredibly precarious. This was the front line of the struggle between the Shaman Dao and the Human Dao—the very center of the chessboard between the two sides.

A risk? An opportunity?

_Best not to think about it for now. I need to find Lady Luofu first._

Having thought it over without coming to any clear conclusion, Li Qi simply finished his meal and went straight to sleep.

Overthinking was useless; he had to find Lady Luofu first and then see what he could gain.

He had only caught Young Master Zhu's eye because of his status as someone of the Outer Dao, so he absolutely could not mess up this first mission.

However, something still felt a bit off.

Even a rabbit like Shen Shuibi was Rank Five, so what rank would Lady Luofu be?

Rank Three? Rank Two?

Could she be a legendary Rank One, capable of moving mountains, filling seas, and plucking the stars and moon from the sky?

Regardless of her rank, based on her current speed, he could roughly estimate her level of power.

The journey to the Tang Empire was no less than a hundred thousand li, yet she had fled all the way here from the Jiannan Dao just to escape with her life. He estimated the distance to be at least two or three hundred thousand li, but according to Shen Shuibi, it had only taken her a single day.

That was a minimum speed of twelve thousand five hundred li per hour.

Flying six thousand kilometers in an hour—how many times the speed of sound was that? And that was for long-distance flight; what if it was her instantaneous burst speed?

It was simply terrifying.

Unimaginable.

Rumor had it that Lady Luofu had fled while heavily injured, and she was even carrying someone along.

If she had been at her peak, she might very well be able to make a round trip between the earth and the moon in a single night.

Traveling the distance between the earth and the moon in one night was just too fucking absurd.

With his mind swirling with these random thoughts, Li Qi gradually drifted off to sleep.

Time flew by, and soon it was the next day.

Today's sacrifice had already been completed, and he had obtained the corresponding divine qi.

The River Breaking had taken place between late winter and early spring. Roughly a month had passed since then, meaning spring was now at its peak.

Hibernating beasts began to emerge, trees sprouted fresh buds, and all of creation returned to life. Seeds were even being sown in some of the fields. When passing by villages from afar, one could see a thriving, prosperous scene.

However, Li Qi was in no mood to admire the scenery, and Old Ma ran as fast as a high-speed bullet train, making it impossible to take in the view anyway.

Shen Shuibi, on the other hand, thoroughly enjoyed the sights, constantly muttering something under her breath: "The various towns of Baiyue possess paddy fields, dry fields, and terraced fields. The terraced fields are suited for planting mountain yams, sweet potatoes, and taro..."

It was likely a record of Baiyue from some ancient tome.

But why was it all about food? She didn't even eat, did she?

Forget it, let her recite what she wanted.

And so, in less than two hours...

They arrived at Yi County.

---

Yi County, one of the thirteen counties of Li Prefecture.

Within the Great Deer Kingdom, Li Prefecture was considered a true prefecture, covering an area of twelve hundred li in circumference. It was divided into three commanderies, comprising a total of thirteen county towns.

Li Qi had previously set off from the Li Prefecture capital city and passed through Feng County, but he had changed directions to find Lady Luofu first.

Therefore, at this moment, he had arrived at Yi County.

After Yi County, taking a slight detour would lead them back to the prefectural capital. Once there, he could seek out the members of the Wave-Rowing Gang and resolve the hidden dangers of the Ox Strength Art.

Looking at the map, they had precisely traversed half of Li Prefecture, which was roughly five to six hundred li.

This truly highlighted the importance of a mount. Over the course of nearly a month, they had walked about four hundred li, yet the final one or two hundred li covered atop Old Ma passed in a mere instant, allowing them to arrive before the morning was even over.

Worthy of being a dragon colt!

However, Li Qi did not let Old Ma casually stride right into the city. Instead, he instructed the horse to wait outside the walls while he had Shen Shuibi lower her head and enter the city alongside him.

There was no other way around it. A young man escorting a beautiful maiden while riding a dragon colt openly into Yi County—such an extravagant display was simply too ostentatious for a county town with a population of barely over a hundred thousand.

Although he was still dressed in coarse linen clothing, who was to say it wasn't just a personal eccentricity? Right?

Simply having Shen Shuibi by his side could be explained away as natural beauty, but adding a dragon colt to the mix would absolutely invite unnecessary trouble.

In fact, if possible, Li Qi didn't even want to bring Shen Shuibi along. He wanted her to stay hidden outside the city with Old Ma while he went in alone, finished his business, and left.

But it couldn't be helped; Shen Shuibi also needed a change of clothes and a new outfit to make traveling easier later on.

She had to come pick them out herself. What else was Li Qi supposed to do—measure her dimensions with his hands?

That probably wouldn't be very appropriate...

Thus, after some consideration, he still brought Shen Shuibi into the city.

He was, after all, somewhat of a cultivator himself now; if they ran into any local ruffians or thugs, he should be able to handle them.

Entering the city was the same as always—no toll was required. However, if one wished to sell goods, they had to enter the designated marketplace. There, a fixed tax of five copper coins was required, and the local government would subsequently take a ten percent cut of all transactions as a commercial tax.

The tax rate in Yi County was not high; it was quite reasonable.

If it were the Li Prefecture capital, on top of the endless layers of road tolls and river taxes, an additional commercial tax would be levied, effectively bringing the rate to fifty percent.

Li Qi paid the five coins and then laid out his animal pelts and bones in the marketplace. He also brought out some leftover boiled goat meat from yesterday. Although it was cold, it was still fresh, unspoiled, and perfectly edible.

In addition to that, he had some fresh mountain goods.

Though he didn't know how to sun-dry them, preserving things like wood ear mushrooms for a day or two wasn't difficult, so he brought some along to sell as well.

Regardless, the priority was to make some money and buy a change of clothes.

Bones, meat, and pelts were by no means cheap, nor were they common. Ordinary traveling merchants and mountain villagers lacked the capability to acquire such items, so the moment he laid them out, a crowd gathered around.

"Little brother, how much are you selling this goat pelt for?"

"Big brother, how much for this piece of fox fur?"

"How much meat is this? Cut me a catty."

In mere minutes, business was booming.

Li Qi had already decided on the prices before entering the city, so he naturally took things in stride, gracefully engaging with the customers and beginning to haggle.

Shen Shuibi squatted off to the side, pretending she was invisible.

Rabbits were always like this.
