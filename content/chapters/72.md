# Chapter 72: Preparation Work

Just as Li Qi was muttering to himself, overwhelmed by emotion, Shen Shuibi choked his words back down with a single sentence.

"Huh? Rank Nine has a threshold?"

The silly rabbit tilted her head, asking in slight surprise.

Li Qi was so stifled he couldn't speak, utterly speechless for a moment.

_Forget it, there's no point arguing._ She was a Rank Five expert. A good temper didn't mean she lacked capability.

"Miss Shen, thank you so much for this. However, I have one more matter I'd like to consult you about." Li Qi cupped his hands and offered a sincere bow.

He truly had to thank her. Otherwise, ascending to Rank Nine would have been incredibly difficult.

Only someone standing at the summit, possessing a commanding view, could so effortlessly devise a method for him to break through to Rank Nine using thirty wisps of water qi.

Had it not been Shen Shuibi, perhaps other Rank Five experts could have done the same, but why would they help him for free?

If he wanted to spend money or offer compensation to secure their aid, what did Li Qi possess that was valuable enough to warrant an expert racking their brains over a problem with zero benefit to themselves?

_Absolutely nothing._

Therefore, Li Qi's heart brimmed with gratitude for Shen Shuibi's assistance, further solidifying his resolve to help her find Lady Luofu.

Favors received must be repaid.

And the best way to repay Shen Shuibi was to help her find Lady Luofu.

"Ah? What else is there?" Shen Shuibi showed not a hint of impatience. She immediately leaned in closer, ready to listen to whatever doubts Li Qi still harbored.

After all, this had happened many times before. Whether Li Qi was reading the [Book of Invocation], encountering bottlenecks in his cultivation, or just chatting in the wilderness, he frequently sought her guidance to broaden his experience and knowledge. Shen Shuibi had long grown accustomed to his questions.

"It's about what happened today. Regarding that cursed piece of gold—"

Li Qi recounted everything he had encountered that day.

This included the matter of Old Madam Wang, their agreement, and the series of events that unfolded after he dealt with the gold.

Once he finished his explanation, Li Qi asked, "Miss Shen, this matter makes sense logically, but does it make sense in terms of Daoist arts? I've heard that most cultivators possess bizarre methods that defy common sense."

Hearing this, Shen Shuibi tilted her head.

"It doesn't sound like there are any issues. But to think Old Ma's past was like this—why didn't he tell me?" Rather than focusing on the validity of the situation, Shen Shuibi was more concerned about Old Ma.

"His nation was destroyed and his former master died. It's best not to bring up such things and needlessly upset him. He hasn't assumed a human form yet, and even though he has gained sentience, his intellect is limited. Let's just drop it," Li Qi advised.

"Mhm!" Shen Shuibi nodded, not overthinking the matter.

She rarely overthought things anyway, generally believing whatever Li Qi told her.

And Li Qi truly felt this way.

Since things had reached this point, there was no need to reopen old wounds and make Old Ma feel guilty.

Without a human form, even with sentience, his intelligence wasn't particularly high. He was like a child. Why force him to talk about his sorrows?

It was fine if Li Qi just handled it himself.

Having received Shen Shuibi's confirmation, Li Qi moved on to ask how he should confront the enemy.

How should he deal with that ghost, or rather, communicate with it?

Yet, upon hearing this question, Shen Shuibi countered in confusion, "You have the inner door god's peach charm on you, as well as the divine qi of the two gods Shentu and Yulei. You also have the willow branch given by the Grand Invocator at your waist, and you are an Invocator yourself. If a ghost runs into you, it should be terrified of you. What are you worried about?"

_Well then, that makes perfect sense._

With that assurance, Li Qi's mind was put at ease.

He then resumed his cultivation practice.

Practice first, read later.

Unremitting daily effort would eventually yield rewards.

The next day, Old Ma and Shen Shuibi remained waiting in the forest. Li Qi, meanwhile, wrapped his long saber in cloth, disguised it as a walking stick, and headed into the city.

He walked all the way to the vicinity of the Wang family estate.

He didn't enter immediately. Instead, he sought out a small street vendor nearby and purchased a woman's hairpin. Woven from copper wire, it was quite beautiful and inexpensive—a piece of rural craftsmanship that cost only fifty copper coins.

Pocketing the hairpin, Li Qi used the purchase as an excuse to strike up a conversation. "Brother, this household with the stone lions at the gate looks incredibly wealthy. Why is their entrance so deserted? They don't even have a servant sweeping the steps."

"Ah? You mean the Wang family? Sigh, who knows what's going on with them. Their businesses used to be booming, but ever since last year, they've been suffering terrible luck every single day." The vendor seemed to be a gossip. Mentioning the rumors immediately energized him.

"Take the end of last year, for example. The Wang family had a shipment of goods destined for the provincial capital. They hired the most reliable escort agency, but the caravan was robbed on the road! The escort agency was trustworthy enough; they paid compensation according to the contract, bought a replacement batch of goods, and even added an extra ten pieces of gold. However, time was apparently of the essence for those goods. Because it didn't arrive on schedule, the buyer in the provincial capital demanded fifty gold pieces just for the breach of contract! The Wang family's patriarch stood outside the escort agency and cursed for an hour, causing a massive uproar."

"Then there's the matter of their servants. It's as if they were cursed with bad luck, constantly tripping and falling. The most unfortunate one had his leg crushed by a carriage. The Wang family spent forty to fifty thousand coins just treating their injuries before finally being forced to dismiss them all."

"If you ask me... this family is simply heartless in their wealth, and the heavens couldn't stand the sight of it anymore!" the vendor declared triumphantly, looking as proud as if he had orchestrated it himself.

"Heartless in their wealth? What terrible deeds did they commit to suffer such divine punishment?" Li Qi asked, feigning curiosity.

"Uh... well, nothing really comes to mind. The Wang family's old matriarch has always been kind, and Patriarch Wang is a straightforward man. Their family hands out porridge to the poor every year. But how many rich people are actually good? If they were truly good people, how could they have gotten so rich?" the vendor reasoned bluntly.

Li Qi nodded. He didn't press the issue, merely exchanging a few more idle words before leaving with the hairpin.

He circled a street and asked a few more neighbors and street vendors.

The stories he heard were all largely the same.

Li Qi grew thoughtful. He completed another loop and finally arrived outside the Wang family's main gate, rapping on the heavy doors.

The old matriarch and Patriarch Wang were already waiting behind it. The moment he knocked, the doors swung open.

"Senior Brother, have you eaten breakfast yet? I have prepared a few light dishes. Shall we head to the tomb after you eat?" the old matriarch stepped forward to greet him.

"That works," Li Qi agreed, stepping over the threshold.

As promised, the food was already laid out. She called them 'light dishes,' but the spread was actually quite lavish. There was meat porridge, egg drop soup, pickled vegetables, and a plate of pan-fried fish—an exceptionally fine breakfast.

Li Qi didn't stand on ceremony, taking a seat and digging right in.

"Have you eaten?" Li Qi asked.

"We have. Please, enjoy your meal, Senior Brother," the old matriarch replied.

It was nearing noon, and the food had grown slightly cold. Without any suspicion, Li Qi set about finishing his morning meal.
