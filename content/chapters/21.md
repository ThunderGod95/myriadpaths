# Chapter 21: Exhaustion

With a sudden grab, he pulled out a woman.

Li Qi froze, momentarily stunned.

But the black mist immediately tried to snatch her back, rushing over with no regard for its own safety!

Li Qi immediately threw her behind him and threw three punches to scatter the advancing mist. However, the mist did not disperse as it had before; instead, it swallowed him whole!

It was as if it were fighting for its life.

"Damn it!" Li Qi was startled, and he immediately began to chant loudly!

"Oh, brilliant Seven Luminaries, shining brightly above! Oh, valiant warrior, how heroic, how heroic!"

The qi and blood in his body immediately boiled, like an ignited barrel of oil!

Brilliant as sunlight, raging as a blazing flame!

Under the empowerment of the Ox Strength Art, Yang qi gushed from his body, and his majestic spirit pushed the surrounding black mist right out.

The black mist wanted to advance, but by then, the other traveling merchants had arrived. They shouted loudly, killing intent soaring, and the clashing of their choppers was filled with the momentum of weapons on a battlefield, instantly scaring the black mist back.

The black mist seemed to hesitate for a moment, then quickly retreated, no longer blocking the path.

"It worked, that son of a bitch is gone, let's move, quickly!" Li Qi saw this, gasped for breath, and immediately spoke to the group behind him.

Although his tone was commanding, no one had any objections at a time like this. Everyone quickly packed their things, hung up their choppers, shouldered their baskets, picked up their torches, and fled into the night.

No one even paid attention to that woman.

Li Qi watched them run off without even caring about the person, and for a moment he didn't know what expression to make...

But it was a life, after all, and the woman seemed to have lost consciousness?

She was probably held captive by this demon too, right?

Li Qi watched the fleeing crowd, unable to make up his mind, but he glanced down at the woman; her clothes were tattered, yet they appeared to be of white silk and gauze—the kind of expensive attire that was obvious at a glance.

However, although expensive, they were covered in mud and dust, tattered and torn, and there were wounds on her body seeping blood, staining the white skirt red.

She had no hairpin and her hair was disheveled; she looked extremely wretched.

She looked just like... a young lady from a wealthy family who had been captured?

Would there be a reward for saving her?

He hesitated for two or three seconds, and when he looked back, the group had already run more than twenty meters away.

And he didn't know if that black mist would return.

"It's unlikely; could a demon capable of shapeshifting be dragged out by me?" Li Qi said to himself, then shouldered the unconscious woman and hurriedly ran after them.

There was no choice; he couldn't just leave her to die, could he? Although it was suspicious, if she were a demon, she would naturally reveal her true form under the sunlight.

If she were the kind of demon that didn't fear sunlight and could perfectly transform into a human, then would saving her or not make any difference?

Wouldn't it be a dead end either way?

With that kind of entity, whether one lived after seeing it depended purely on its mood. Perhaps saving its life would make the demon happy, and there might even be benefits, right?

After all, Li Qi still had a conscience; leaving a woman who looked powerless to truss a chicken lying on the roadside to die would make him feel at least somewhat guilty.

It was only a day's journey to Feng County; he could manage to carry her there.

With this thought, he hesitated no longer, shouldering the person and relying on his physical fitness to catch up at high speed.

The group ran just as they said they would, running for over an hour. Even though they all had cultivation methods, such a mad dash on mountain roads, combined with the exhaustion from the first half of the night, left them all as tired as dead dogs.

What surprised Li Qi even more was that after an hour of mad running, a living person carried on a shoulder should have been shaken to death, or if half-dead, shaken back to life, yet the woman on his back remained unconscious.

However, given that this was a world of monsters and miracles, he couldn't say much. He would just get her to the city first, and deal with it then if no one claimed her.

More than two hours later, there was already a faint light on the horizon. Only then did the group stop, collapsing by the mountain road, leaning against rocks, completely exhausted, with some even vomiting from fatigue.

"Don't drink water yet, wait until you've rested enough before drinking!" the burly man ordered the traveling merchants, then leaned against a tree himself, tired to death.

Li Qi had it even worse. Although he didn't carry the merchants' baskets, he was still moving under a heavy load. The woman weighed eighty or ninety jin. Carrying her for a while wasn't noticeable, but running with her for two hours was truly killing him. He found a random spot, put the woman down, and without caring if the ground was dirty, decisively collapsed, gasping for air.

Tired, he was truly too tired.

These two hours of mad dashing had likely covered nearly eighty li, and it was a cross-country run with a heavy load; it nearly cost Li Qi his life. Since he started practicing cultivation methods, he had never been this tired—even pulling boats, he wouldn't pull for two hours straight!

Although the pile of dead dogs were gasping, the burly man was the first to recover.

After recovering a bit of strength, he walked over to Li Qi and sat down heavily. "You don't look very strong, but I didn't expect you to be so brave. I'm Ba Kui, what's your name?"

"Li Qi..." Li Qi answered weakly; he hadn't recovered yet.

"Li Qi, sorry about what happened during the day. My temper is a bit explosive, and I can't help it when I hear people gossiping. But I didn't expect that while you look thin and small, you're a real man. We'll reach Feng County today, and when we do, it's a promise—I must treat you to a drink! Let's celebrate!" Ba Kui slapped Li Qi on the shoulder and laughed heartily.

"Definitely, definitely..." Li Qi was still limp and weak, and after being slapped, he simply fell back down.

For some reason, he felt exceptionally tired.

After all, he used to do manual labor often, and he felt his endurance shouldn't be bad; even if tired, he should be able to recover quickly.

But at this moment, he felt especially exhausted, as if no amount of rest would help.

It felt like... recovering from a serious illness, a feeling of physical deficiency?

But he didn't seem to have done anything that would cause such a deficiency, right?

"By the way, Li Qi, what do you plan to do with this dame you carried back? She hasn't woken up yet; she's probably had her vital essence sucked by that demon. She's just a burden, and it might be hard to travel with her. Did you take a fancy to her?" Ba Kui looked at the unconscious woman.

"I just didn't want to leave her to die, I couldn't just leave her alone, could I?" Li Qi wiped his sweat, then took a small sip of water.

"Here, this will help you recover faster." Ba Kui reached out, holding a paper packet in his hand.

Li Qi took it, opened it, and found brown-black granules inside.

"Salt. When you're tired, drink a mouthful of water and take a pinch of salt; you'll have strength back in no time," Ba Kui said.

"Thanks." Li Qi thanked him, pinched a little, and put it in his mouth.

The first sensation wasn't saltiness, but bitterness.

But that was normal. With this kind of coarse salt, the salt content might be less than the sand content. It was good enough that it could replenish his strength.
