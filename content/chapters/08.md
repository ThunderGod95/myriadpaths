# Chapter 8: Deliberations

That was why he had steeled his heart and dispatched his men to intercept and kill him directly!

Murder was no small matter.

Generally speaking, Li Prefecture was still part of a nation with strict laws. Stealing previously had already carried significant risk; the reason he had dared to order the theft was mainly because Li Qi had never produced that Outer Dao object.

He couldn't prove that strange object belonged to him, so even if he reported it to the officials, they wouldn't find anything. Coupled with the backing of a major figure, Lu Shan had nothing to fear.

But things were different now. Putting aside that murder was far more serious than theft, it was also different from the theft which left no evidence behind to warrant anyone's attention.

If a murder caused a stir, Diviners would definitely come to investigate the clues.

He hadn't wanted to take it this far.

However, having the spell art stolen was something he absolutely could not tolerate.

Even if he had to risk being exposed, he had to do it.

Thus, he had made extensive arrangements, repeatedly instructing his capable subordinates to keep their hands clean and ensure, as much as possible, that Li Qi’s death would leave no proof.

He also had people monitoring the Wave-Rowing Gang to prevent them from making any moves.

He planned only to kill the spying Li Qi to put an end to the spell art spreading, without making a public scene.

Now was not the time to make a scene. The divine will inheritance was too profound; he needed at least a year to study it. By then, he could gather the gang members who had accepted the divine will inheritance and move to annex other territories!

Relying on a single spell art, he could easily overturn the entire riverside. In Li Prefecture, there could only be one tracker gang!

A tracker gang capable of developing into a faction like the Fishmonger Head’s, monopolizing business across the entire city.

It wouldn't quite be a major sect, but it certainly wouldn't be at the absolute bottom anymore.

Plundering the cultivation methods of the other two factions, combined with a new spell art, would definitely allow the Strong Force Gang to reach a higher level!

For this, accepting some risk was entirely acceptable.

All he had to do was eliminate Li Qi, then lie low and train bitterly for just one year.

It wasn't his first time killing. The influence of bottom-tier gangs was interlocked like jagged teeth; in their mutual skirmishes, a few deaths were common. If no one reported it, the government couldn't be bothered to intervene.

Officials did not investigate unless citizens filed a complaint. That was how it worked at the bottom. Struggles between lower-tier forces were too normal to manage.

However, if someone insisted on reporting it, the government would still step in. Government regulations included an annual assessment, where the homicide clearance rate was a crucial statistic.

For instance, regarding the theft of Li Qi's Outer Dao object—if he had truly reported it, constables would have taken action. Whether they found anything was another matter, but the government would have at least intervened.

But if the government lacked confidence in solving the case, they would generally turn a blind eye to a homicide. Failing to solve a case meant a large mark of failure, leading to harsh criticism from superiors at year's end.

Furthermore, as long as the government could be made to back off, there was no need to worry about the Wave-Rowing Gang filing a complaint.

After all, did the Wave-Rowing Gang lack a dark history? If he reported it and others reported back, dragging each other down, then no one would survive.

Breaking the rules would definitely drag in the Water Horse Gang, or even the Fishmonger Head and the Water Transport Army!

That would truly be a point of no return.

Lu Shan thought to himself, _Everything had been calculated precisely; there would surely be no slip-ups._

Only, he was waiting with some anxiety.

The lookouts were one thing, but why hadn't the men sent to kill returned yet?

Those were the two best fighters in the gang aside from himself. Each possessed roughly seven hundred kilograms of brute force. A single blow from their hammers could shatter boulders.

He knew Li Qi's capabilities.

With Wave-Shattering Force, fighting one against two in the water would be effortless for him. He could even turn the tables and kill them.

But on land, he could handle one at most. With two attacking together, especially in an ambush, there was absolutely no chance of survival.

Just as Lu Shan was growing anxious, the person he was waiting for finally returned.

"Boss Shan!" A short, stout youth darted in from outside.

"What happened? Did something happen at the Wave-Rowing Gang?" Lu Shan stood up and asked hurriedly.

This was one of the men he had sent to monitor the Wave-Rowing Gang. There were three in total, but it seemed only one had returned, likely to report, while the other two remained on watch.

"Boss Shan, Li Qi went back, but he seems injured, and badly too. The Wave-Rowing Gang is in chaos right now. They're all discussing selling pigs to hire a doctor!" The youth spoke happily, his tone overflowing with joy.

But Lu Shan's expression sank abruptly.

Injured?

The ones sent to kill didn't come back?

_Damn it, is this Li Qi that strong!?_

"Go back first. Continue monitoring the situation over there and try to figure out the specific state of Li Qi's injury." Lu Shan said with a dark face.

"Boss Shan, the three of us saw it clearly. He pretended to be fine when he came back, but blood was still seeping through his clothes. He walked two steps and took a tumble. He's definitely hurt bad! Don't know what he ran into, hehe, serves him right!" The short, stout youth was overjoyed.

But this cheerfulness sounded increasingly grating to Lu Shan’s ears.

"Enough, shut up. Hurry back and keep watching. Report back if anything happens!" Suppressing his anger, he waved his hand and shooed the subordinate away.

The short, stout youth didn't know why the boss's face had suddenly turned dark, but he didn't want to court bad luck, so he scampered off immediately.

As for Lu Shan, he closed his eyes, pondering the intelligence he had just received.

Li Qi wasn't dead, but it was very likely he was injured.

Could he be faking it?

It was possible; that fellow had always been cunning.

But the probability was low. He knew Li Qi's skills well. Those two were his capable lieutenants, with strength that ranked highly among all three gangs.

It was impossible for someone of Li Qi's ability to escape unscathed.

Then it seemed likely that Li Qi had been incredibly crafty, using a stratagem to lure the two into the water, and then killing them there.

That was the only possibility. Only in the water, leveraging _Wave-Shattering Force_, could he possibly achieve that.

Deducing these events left Lu Shan sitting in his chair, his expression fluctuating uncertainly, his face alternating between flushed and dark.

_Whether he's injured or not, I can't hesitate. Him being alive is the biggest threat. I cannot let him learn that spell art!_ Lu Shan steeled his heart and made up his mind.

Although he didn't even know the name of that spell art—since a divine will inheritance required one to comprehend it personally, essentially like having a teacher instructing inside one's brain—whether one could learn it still depended on oneself.

That important figure had told him that with his natural talent, it might take a year to grasp the basics, and by then, he would naturally know the name of the spell art.

However, he couldn't wait a year now.

He stood up abruptly. "I'm going all out!"

Then, he walked out the door and gave a loud shout, summoning all the nearby trackers.

He would take advantage of the night, and the fact that the Wave-Rowing Gang was currently full of food and wine, surely drowsy.

He would muster his men, launch a night raid on the Wave-Rowing Gang, and kill Li Qi!

Even if the government investigated afterward, he could claim this was a counterattack following the theft of his cultivation method.

That way, as long as he didn't slaughter indiscriminately, the culpability surely wouldn't be too heavy.

If the government wanted to pursue the matter further, it would definitely implicate that important figure.

Although he didn't know who the other party was, anyone who could casually produce a spell art and speak so much about the Dao must have enough influence to deter the government if dragged into this!

He was betting it all!
