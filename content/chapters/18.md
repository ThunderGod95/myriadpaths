# Chapter 18: Encounter

"Have they run into trouble?" Li Qi looked toward Ah Du, seeking his opinion.

"We should take a detour. No matter what it is, don't get involved!" Ah Du said immediately. He had experience with such things. Regardless of the situation, rushing in blindly was never a good idea.

Li Qi nodded. Since the other party seemed capable of handling it, they would take a detour. Better to avoid unnecessary trouble than to seek it out; it was best not to let any unexpected twists arise.

The two companions made up their minds and turned decisively, darting from the mountain path directly into the forest.

By traveling through the woods for a stretch before looping back to the path, they would bypass the area entirely. This way, any danger would be drawn away by the merchant group, effectively allowing them to slip by unnoticed.

However, just as they were about to enter the forest, they heard a burly man among the merchants step forward and shout, "You two kids over there! Don't go into the mountains!"

Li Qi found the voice somewhat familiar. He looked up and saw a recognizable face.

It was the same burly man who had stood up wanting to teach him a lesson earlier that day.

After shouting that single sentence, the man spoke no more. Instead, he focused on swinging a chopper, clashing it against others while constantly shouting rhythmically.

Li Qi clearly saw that once the man began this action, the progress bar for the barrier accelerated significantly—which meant its duration was being shortened drastically.

Under these circumstances... it was obvious the man was risking himself to warn them!

"Ah Du! Stop! Don't go into the forest!" Li Qi immediately halted and shouted loudly at Ah Du!

But Ah Du already had one foot inside the treeline.

Li Qi's pupils constricted. He clearly saw a progress bar emerge from the darkness:

<div class="rustic-frame">

Attack.

</div>

Seeing the bar nearly full, he lunged forward, grabbed Ah Du's back basket, and yanked him back with a forceful pull!

Just as Ah Du escaped the danger, a massive, foul-smelling maw burst from the darkness of the forest. It was nothing but a mouth, lacking even a head, as if the darkness itself had opened its jaws!

There was no time to sing now. With a mere thought, Li Qi’s body suddenly surged. His muscles writhed as he clenched his fist and threw a violent punch!

With a loud bang, the ground vibrated. Li Qi felt his fist go numb, as if he had struck solid stone.

However, the giant maw was shattered by the blow, dissolving into a black mist that dissipated into the air.

Following that punch, the surrounding forest suddenly began to churn!

"Roar!" The faint howling of beasts echoed from the woods. The previously silent, deep darkness began to flow like water, swirling and pitch-black. Rolling black qi roamed through the trees, giving Li Qi an intuitive understanding of what was meant by a 'demonic aura.'

Ah Du turned pale with fright. He immediately began to sing, shouting, "Oh, brilliant Seven Luminaries, shining brightly above!"

Surprisingly, this was effective. Li Qi could see a reinforcement progress bar appearing on him. Simultaneously, the surrounding black mist was pushed back slightly.

As Ah Du sang the song, his body began to emit a faint glow. A warm light radiated from him, dispelling the chill as the black mist began to retreat.

Li Qi understood at a glance; the folk song the other man had taught him was certainly meant to be used in conjunction with a specific cultivation method. However, such methods could not be taught to outsiders, so only Ah Du could exert the song's full power.

The black mist was repelled for a moment, but Ah Du didn't hesitate to bolt, charging toward the place where the people were gathered.

Seeing this, Li Qi immediately ran as well.

It would be foolish not to run. There was strength in numbers, and the way those men were clashing their blades was so imposing it was clearly effective!

Taking two steps at a time with his great strength, Li Qi quickly reached the merchant group.

The merchants did not block them; instead, they actively moved closer to the pair, their choppers clashing incessantly in a continuous din of metal.

Ah Du scrambled over as well. The Yang qi radiating from the faint light on his body, combined with the clashing of weapons, created a sudden surge in momentum. The surrounding black mist and demonic aura were forced back, unable to advance.

Seeing this, Li Qi also began to sing loudly, chanting with that strange rhythm: "Oh, brilliant Seven Luminaries, shining brightly above! Oh, valiant warrior, how heroic, how heroic!"

He possessed the Ox Strength Art and abundant blood qi. Stimulated by the chant, a wave of steaming heat rolled off him like an exhaust vent. His skin, already flushed red from the Ox Strength Art, turned a deeper shade of bronze—not just red, but possessing a metallic luster.

The Yang qi erupting from Li Qi was actually more robust than that of Ah Du, who possessed the matching cultivation method!

With Li Qi and Ah Du there to support them, the members of the merchant group showed looks of joy. It seemed they might actually survive the night.

The group shared a silent understanding. Although they couldn't communicate verbally because of the constant chanting and shouting, both sides knew exactly what to do. They knew that even if they left now, they wouldn't get far; their primary goal was to endure until dawn when the sun rose.

This black mist could be dispelled by Yang qi, and the Yang qi of sunlight was thousands of times more concentrated than that of a human. Once day broke, the black mist would surely be completely scattered.

Thus, the group formed a circle. Ignoring their exhaustion, they did not dare stop the clashing of their choppers or their rhythmic shouting for even a moment. Their arms grew sore, their mouths went soft, and their throats burned with pain, yet they didn't even have the time to take a sip of water.

Initially, Li Qi could rely on the Ox Strength Art to burst forth massive amounts of Yang qi. But once ten minutes passed and the duration of the spell ended, he became the least useful among them. He could only rely on his strong physique and endurance to fill in when others were flagging.

In this manner, the group endured for a full two hours in the dark of night.

Looking at the phase of the moon, it was still the Hour of the Rat; there was still a long way to go before dawn.

The clashing of blades and boiling Yang qi kept the black mist from advancing an inch.

Yet, the black mist seemed to have a vendetta against this group, refusing to leave. It circled and whistled around them, as if waiting for everyone to die of exhaustion.

After singing for two hours, Li Qi frowned and simply stopped. He was the least effective anyway; his silence wouldn't significantly impact the overall situation.

He stopped but did not rest. Standing beside Ah Du, he addressed the crowd, "This can't go on. We won't make it until tomorrow. By the time we're all spent, we'll be dead."

As he spoke, he scanned the group. In just two hours, Ah Du was already dripping with sweat, and though his voice hadn't gone hoarse yet, it was becoming weak and strained.

Clashing the choppers was even more physically demanding. Some of the weaker members of the group were already soaked in sweat and panting heavily. They might hold on for another two hours, but any longer and they would surely collapse to the ground.

As Li Qi spoke, the others looked toward him without stopping their work. Clearly, they were aware of the situation but had no idea how to change it.

After all, stopping meant risking their lives.

"Listen to me, everyone. I have an idea," Li Qi told them.
