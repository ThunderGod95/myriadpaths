# Chapter 14: The Tea Stall

"Huff... huff." Li Qi gasped for air, moving with faltering steps.

He was already over a fifty kilometers away from Li Prefecture City. Although he hadn't left the jurisdiction yet, the population was already sparse.

To be honest, this was the first time Li Qi had walked this far in this world.

In this world, most people would never leave their hometowns in their entire lives; at the very least, Li Prefecture was like that.

People in the villages, the farthest place they had been was likely the county town. People in the county town, the farthest they went was the prefecture city; and people in the prefecture city might never leave the prefecture city in their lives.

Li Qi had never left the prefecture city, not once in over three years. At most, he helped pull boats at the shallows in the city against the current, returning once they reached the smooth waters of the outskirts.

If he hadn't been pushed to the brink by this homicide and flight, he wouldn't have wanted to leave the city either.

From his work at the docks, hauling boats and listening to the idle chatter of the various canal gangs and chambers of commerce, he knew well the dangers of the wild.

The water had demons. With good luck, it was a carp spirit or a turtle monster that only teased and didn't hurt people. With bad luck, it was a water monkey, and everyone on the boat would die in the river unless protected by a high-level cultivator.

If one avoided the water and took the mountain roads, the mountains were also full of forests and swamps, teeming with snakes, insects, rats, ants, vicious beasts, and birds of prey.

The only truly safe places were human settlements.

Going out meant danger.

He had been gone for a day, making do sleeping in a tree for one night. Fortunately, he hadn't encountered any problems. He ate some wild fruit and, according to the original plan, he was going to Feng County, one hundred fifty kilometres away.

It was said that Feng County was a relatively stable small county town. Li Qi would lay low there, pass a year or so, and then return to Li Prefecture City. That way, there would be no issues.

Trekking fifty kilometres in one day, all on rugged mountain paths, and wearing straw sandals—even with his current physical fitness, he was tired enough to choke.

The only good point was that it was currently winter, so the myriad beasts were hibernating and the insects hadn't spawned yet. Along the way, aside from exhaustion, there were no other torments.

"Even if I don't take the wrong road, there's still one hundred and fifty kilometers... really." Li Qi walked on the desolate path, looking around everywhere to see if there were any roadside tea stalls or water shops. He had already walked for a whole day.

After looking around for a while, his luck was good; he actually found a roadside tea stall.

He sped up, simultaneously reaching into the bundle on his back to take out two copper coins.

The Great Deer Kingdom's copper coins were named Great Deer Wuzhu. They were purple in color and of decent weight, though somewhat thin; one weighed about half a *qian*. He currently had about a thousand coins on him, which was one string.

The Great Deer Wuzhu was the official circulating currency of the Great Deer Kingdom; most of the money issued from the River Breaking was of this type. However, it wasn't actually worth much. The most common currency on the market was still a type of copper coin called Deyuan Tongbao, which contained more copper and circulated widely. It seemed to be the copper coin of the Tang Empire. One Deyuan Tongbao was worth five Great Deer Wuzhu.

In fact, the weight unit 'one qian' in this world referred to the weight of one Deyuan Tongbao coin.

Even the unit of weight used another country's currency. From this alone, Li Qi already knew how powerful the Tang Empire of this world was.

Although this Tang Empire likely had nothing to do with the Tang of his own world.

However, there was one difference in this world. Although there was officially minted money, silver did not circulate. Economic activities relied almost entirely on copper coins, and only in very rare circumstances was gold used to pay bills.

Even bills of exchange and the like were recorded in copper coins; gold notes were used only in extremely rare, large transactions.

Silver seemed to have been kicked out of the economic system. Li Qi didn't quite understand the specific reason.

The one thousand Great Deer Wuzhu Li Qi carried were one thousand coins in the Great Deer Kingdom. The purchasing power was actually quite good, enough to buy half of a small pig, which meant three or four hundred *jin* of meat.

Generally speaking, one *jin* of meat was a price of two or three coins. Two copper coins were enough to drink a pot of tea at a tea stall and eat two plates of accompanying small snacks.

However, these two or three coins—in normal times, Li Qi would absolutely not bear to spend them on food.

Two or three coins were enough to buy two or three jin of rice. People in this world generally had large appetites; there were plenty who ate ten jin of rice in one meal. Two or three jin of rice would only be ten jin when steamed.

Besides, pork was cheap. The expensive beef and mutton cost two or three times as much, truly not something he could afford to eat. After all, tracking was physical labor; without eating one's fill, there was no strength. So, in most cases, he filled up on white rice. For dishes, having some salted vegetables was considered good; if not, he made do with water plants and salt.

Occasionally, he had fish to improve his diet, but fish... eating river fish without seasoning was truly a form of torture. If not for nutritional considerations, Li Qi would rather just eat plain white rice.

Fortunately, there was enough white rice.

He prayed for the farmer who grew the spirit rice. If not for him, who knew how many people in this world would have starved to death? At the very least, cultivation methods couldn't have become so widespread.

No matter what cultivation method, it had to be built on eating. Without sufficient nutrition, everything else was nonsense.

Oh, except for spell arts. To this day, Li Qi didn't know what the power source of the Ox Strength Art was.

The existence of spirit rice ensured that manual laborers like him wouldn't die of exhaustion and hunger. Li Qi didn't know the inventor, nor had he heard of him, but he often prayed for that old man.

Such merit was enough to be revered as a saint, right?

While revering the old man, Li Qi walked toward the tea stall.

Now that he had a spell art, perhaps he could try to find some other way to make money.

The stuff he had learned in his brain was said to come from... Qi.

But what the fuck was Qi?

He didn't understand; he would learn slowly later. Something like a divine will inheritance sounded like it wasn't a common commodity. Trying to get another one like the Ox Strength Art would probably take a very, very long time.

Clutching the two copper coins tightly in his hand, Li Qi walked up to the roadside tea stall.

"Tea Master, a pot of tea!" Li Qi slapped down the two copper coins and shouted loudly.

There were quite a few people around. Even in winter, the traveling merchants didn't rest. They were gathered at the stall, drinking tea and taking a break before shouldering their large bamboo baskets to peddle their wares among the villages.

However, the merchants were clearly divided. Different baskets sat together, evidently forming different cliques. Only Li Qi sat alone between two groups of merchants, looking out of place.

"Coming right up!" The Tea Master shouted, quickly coming over to wipe the table for Li Qi enthusiastically, then serving a pot of tea and two complimentary plates of cakes.

They were all rice cakes, made from spirit rice.

They were complimentary, after all, so they couldn't be anything too fancy. Rice cakes were already quite generous.

Li Qi picked up a piece and chewed on it in large bites. Although the raw material was also rice, it had a bit more flavor than plain white rice. Added to his hunger, it tasted quite good.

After eating a piece of rice cake, he gulped down a large cup of warm tea.

The tea wasn't hot, just barely warm. After all, the customers of this kind of tea stall were hardworking people coming and going; they couldn't endure thirst to wait for tea to cool. So, it was all warm water and tea leaves that had been steeping all day. It had almost no fragrance to speak of, and could only be said to barely have a taste of tea leaves.

"Phew..." But Li Qi was already very satisfied. At this speed, he should be able to reach Feng County by tomorrow evening, right?

Just then, however, someone suddenly spoke to Li Qi from behind, "This big brother, traveling far alone?"
