# Chapter 58: Consequences

Even though Li Qi did not mind, Old Ma appeared deeply ashamed and chose to leave of his own accord.

Li Qi grew anxious; with Old Ma gone, was he supposed to rely on his own two legs to find Lady Luofu?

Hearing his panicked muttering, Shen Shuibi looked delighted and stood up to call out into the near distance.

In the end, Old Ma returned.

However, while a horse could not blush, his emotions were still vividly apparent in those guilt-ridden eyes.

_Truly worthy of a dragon colt that has awakened its spirit; his expressions are so vivid._

Li Qi said nothing else. As Old Ma drew near and nuzzled him with his snout, Li Qi simply propped himself up, patted the horse's neck, and said, "What's the use of all that? We help each other out. That's all there is to it."

Afterward, he let Old Ma wander off to graze.

Then, he turned to the subject he was truly interested in—the so-called Carp Stream Intent.

According to Shen Shuibi, this was a Martial Dao method that imitated the movements of a carp. It was quite crude, only allowing one to cultivate up to Rank Eight at the highest, which was why it was known as a Rank Eight cultivation method.

It was Li Qi's first time hearing about such a grading system, but it seemed quite logical.

Cultivation methods had their limits. A crude art like the Wave-Shattering Force, even when mastered to perfection like Li Qi had achieved, could only barely produce a single trace of inner qi by actively straining the body, making it utterly unranked trash.

Something like the [Book of Invocation] was a Rank One cultivation method, which meant this tradition provided a direct path straight to Rank One without any detours, as all the inherent dangers had already been paved over by the lives of their predecessors.

However, since cultivation methods were entirely created by humans, someone practicing a lower-tier cultivation method could still rely on their own talent and grit to shatter those limits and forge their own path—though it would undoubtedly require enduring an immense amount of suffering.

A complete cultivation method generally consisted of four separate texts: the method, the classic, the treasure manual, and the strange records.

The *method* itself, as the name implied, detailed the exact steps for cultivation. These were mostly kept very simple, because if the core practices were overly complex, they would become far too difficult to propagate and learn.

Generally speaking, they were easy to initiate, merely requiring slow, grinding effort. For instance, with Li Qi's Invocator cultivation method, he needed to make offerings to the Heavenly Gods of the four seasons, then offer sacrifices to the corresponding Earthly Divinities every single day without pause for an entire year. Only after waiting until the seasonal qi within his personal cosmos was complete and the divine qi of the Earthly Divinities reached perfection could he finally be considered Rank Nine.

Cultivation methods were rarely lengthy, usually consisting of only a few hundred words or ten thousand characters at most. Anything longer was simply not worth reading because it was guaranteed to be a trash cultivation method.

They conveyed profound meaning through concise phrasing to clarify the critical junctures of cultivation. But how could there possibly be *that* many junctures? Any text written too extensively could simply be ignored, as it was undoubtedly full of empty talk and sheer nonsense.

Therefore, in certain places within the Daoist Tradition, a core cultivation method might be nothing more than a single poem.

Next came the *classic*, which was the true bulk of cultivation.

If you only had the method, you would practice blindly without understanding the underlying reasoning or the core intent, turning you into an ignorant fool who only knew how to train. Such a person could only serve as a deathsworn soldier and could never be considered a true cultivator.

Only by obtaining the accompanying classic could one find an explanation of the 'Dao'—detailing the philosophy, the core principles, the ultimate pursuit, and the very essence of the Dao you were cultivating.

Every cultivator was a seeker of the Dao. If they merely practiced without even understanding their own path, they were nothing more than a savage beast with a cultivation base, entirely unworthy of being called a Dao seeker.

Generally speaking, a cultivation method would always be paired with a classic; the two were completely inseparable.

Possessing only the classic was mere armchair philosophy, while possessing only the method made one a brute who could train all day without ever knowing what they were actually cultivating.

Following that was the *treasure manual*.

The treasure manual, as its name suggested, cataloged the treasures relevant to one's specific path, the necessary cultivation resources, the various allied sects along this Dao, the distinctions within the Daoist Tradition, as well as an array of spell arts, applications for one's cultivation base, and diverse esoteric techniques. Although these could not draw one closer to the Dao itself, they could effectively enhance one's methods and overall combat prowess.

The Dao was the foundational principle.

The spell art was the technique that utilized that principle.

Manuals like this were generally only possessed by major Daoist Traditions and were compiled specifically for their disciples. Those from ordinary traditions did not actually have access to many spell arts; they relied entirely on a few techniques passed down by word of mouth, making it highly unlikely they would ever need a dedicated treasure manual to record them.

Finally, there were the *strange records*.

These texts served as an encyclopedia for your chosen path, documenting boundless knowledge, various taboos, adaptations, and more. According to Shen Shuibi, reading it was entirely optional, but skipping it would leave one seemingly uncultured and completely oblivious to the world around them.

As for what exactly these strange records contained, that depended entirely on the overarching caliber of your master's sect and Daoist Tradition.

Lesser traditions could only document minor local occurrences or passing rumors.

Conversely, major traditions encompassed the myriad phenomena of the world, containing absolutely everything.

After Shen Shuibi finished her explanation, she offered an example: "Take your [Book of Invocation], Li Qi. It is a complete cultivation method that encompasses the method itself, the classic, the treasure manual, and the strange records. Since the Shaman Dao is a first-rate, major Daoist Tradition in this world, it naturally possesses an incredibly comprehensive system."

"But disciples of major traditions are in the minority after all. For those who start late or stumble onto the path of cultivation through fortuitous encounters, their foundations will always be lacking in these four aspects, making their pursuit of the Dao exceptionally grueling. However, the Dao must never be imparted lightly. You cannot just casually hand out your cultivation method, because if you do, not only will you face severe punishment yourself, but the recipients will inevitably be cursed to death by the diviners of Shaman God Mountain," Shen Shuibi warned sternly.

Once, numerous traditions had joined forces, intending to spread their teachings widely across the world so that everyone could embark on the pursuit of the Dao.

But what this ultimately brought was sheer disaster—an era of great chaos that swept across the entire world.

Li Qi nodded to show his understanding.

If knowledge was acquired too easily, trouble was guaranteed to follow.

This was especially true for the knowledge of cultivation, which was not merely information, but a weapon.

Completely opening the thoroughfare of cultivation to everyone without any form of screening was equivalent to opening an armory to the general populace.

While some could restrain themselves, others would not care at all about what the 'Dao' represented; they merely wanted to grab a Gatling gun and spray bullets everywhere.

The only ultimate outcome of such an action would be pure disaster.

The warning that the Dao could not be imparted lightly was undoubtedly a lesson paid in blood. The requisite qualities, mindset, and assorted miscellaneous requirements to be a seeker of the Dao were simply too numerous. While casually handing out cultivation methods to others might unveil a wealth of hidden cultivation geniuses, it came at a terrible cost.

Simultaneously, it would grant an entire horde of ordinary people access to weapons and power they were never meant to possess.

With a sharp blade in hand, the urge to kill arises naturally.

Such was human nature; upon mastering power that exceeded their mental fortitude, they would invariably lose themselves to it.

Therefore, Li Qi expressed his profound agreement with the notion that the Dao could never be imparted lightly.

Having delivered her warnings, the rabbit appeared incredibly serious about the subject matter.

However, right after showing such absolute seriousness, she immediately reverted to her adorable self, leaning close to Li Qi to enthusiastically explain the Carp Stream Intent cultivation method to him.
