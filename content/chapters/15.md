# Chapter 15: The Three Treasures

Hearing someone call out to him from behind, Li Qi immediately turned around to look at the person.

Upon turning his head, he discovered it was a traveling merchant.

However, this merchant’s basket was different from those of the two surrounding merchant groups. He appeared to be setting out alone, just like Li Qi.

That was a bit strange.

Logically speaking, no one in this world would travel far alone.

After all, as mentioned before, this world was very dangerous.

There were exceptions, of course, such as fugitives on the run for murder like Li Qi, or those who were forced to leave their homes for some specific reason.

But Li Qi had never heard of a traveling merchant setting out on the road alone.

Was he not afraid of death?

"Um... excuse me, big brother." The traveling merchant walked over and sat down beside Li Qi.

Li Qi was slightly guarded, though he did not chase the man away. He simply sized him up. "Little brother, is something the matter?"

"Oh, it's like this. I saw that you are also setting out alone, so... I came over to say hello." The merchant looked a bit nervous, but he spoke up regardless.

"So, I thought, since we are both traveling separately, why don't we partner up? It would be good to have someone to look out for each other on the road." The young merchant proposed.

"Travel together? Where are you headed?" Li Qi asked, simultaneously assessing the other man's physique.

Traveling alone was dangerous, and having a companion was indeed a good thing, but one could not do without a guarded heart; being careful was never a mistake.

"I am going to Bi County. What about you, big brother? I saw you coming from that direction as well. There is only one road here, with no forks or turns. We should be on the same path until Feng County at least. From here to the next inhabited place is at least fifty *li*, so we can share the road for fifty *li* at worst." The merchant said.

"Oh, right, what is your name, big brother? My surname is Du, just call me Ah Du." Ah Du introduced himself, and then he placed his own tea and snacks on the table, set down his leather-covered basket, and took a seat.

"I am Li Qi." Li Qi did not hide his name, but he looked at Ah Du and responded, "Listening to your words, you seem very familiar with this road. If you know it so well, why do you need to walk with me?"

Ah Du gave a bitter smile. "It is precisely because I am familiar with it that I want a partner. To be honest, big brother, this road is not very peaceful. Look at the surrounding merchants; which of them sets off with fewer than ten people?"

"If I had any other choice, if I didn't urgently need money, I wouldn't want to travel with goods alone either..." Ah Du said to Li Qi with a helpless expression.

This reason was quite sufficient, but Li Qi still did not agree immediately. He frowned slightly. "Not peaceful? Did something happen?"

Speaking of this, Ah Du leaned in closer and lowered his voice. "On this road, demons haunt the area."

"Demons? And people still dare to go?" Li Qi was startled.

Working at the docks, he had heard the passing chamber of commerce members and canal gangs talk about demons more than once. In his impression, demons were terrifying existences that could easily slaughter over a dozen people.

"It is only a rumor. It shouldn't be a true demon, but rather a wild beast on the verge of attaining sentience. These creatures that are close to becoming spirits but haven't yet... as long as there are many people and the Yang qi is vigorous, they will be afraid. So traveling in groups is safest. As for people like us... we can only make do and try our luck."

"Sigh, if not forced by life, who would go far from home alone..." Ah Du began to sigh and lament. "Demons are scary, but there are plenty of things scarier than demons."

Li Qi felt deeply sympathetic toward this sentiment.

The Strong Force Gang had tried to kill him twice in a single day. He had managed to turn the tables with great difficulty, only to be forced to flee to the ends of the earth to lay low. Even if there were demons now, he had not the slightest thought of turning back, which sufficiently proved the truth of those words.

Seeing Li Qi nod slightly, seeming to agree with his statement, Ah Du seized the opportunity and immediately followed up. "Moreover, Big Brother Li, I didn't just see that you were walking alone and dangerous, leading me to want to partner with you. Look, your Qi and blood are vigorous, and your Yang qi is sufficient. Those small beasts that haven't become demons yet fear people like you the most. As for me, I have experience as a traveling merchant. If the two of us combine forces, I guarantee there won't be any problems!" Ah Du was articulate, his speech coming in smooth sets.

Li Qi looked at the other party and felt he didn't seem to be lying.

Besides, even if the other party was lying, as long as Li Qi didn't follow his route and didn't let him lead the way, there shouldn't be a problem.

Furthermore, if there really were such beasts on the verge of refining into spirits, having someone by his side would add a sense of security. The other party was a traveling merchant familiar with the roads; being able to walk the wilderness meant he had at least some skill, so he wouldn't be unable to resist if they encountered a demon.

And, in the absolute worst-case scenario, he didn't need to outrun the demon; he just had to run faster than him.

Thinking of this, Li Qi nodded. "Since that is the case, then let us travel the same road. I am going to Feng County, so we can walk together for about two hundred *li*."

"Hehe, that's enough, that's enough. Once we reach Feng County, the area will be more populated. There are local spirit mediums, the government's Demon Suppression Division, and Garrison Envoys. Few demons dare to make a move in such a place. The most dangerous part is the middle two hundred *li*. No one governs it, the road is rotten, and it is prone to the appearance of ghosts and monsters!" Receiving a positive reply, Ah Du breathed a sigh of relief and began to joke around cheerfully.

"Big Brother Li, looking at your appearance, you probably haven't traveled far before, right? Since we are drinking tea and have nothing to do right now, how about this little brother tells you some interesting stories from the road to relieve the boredom?" Sitting down, Ah Du adopted a familiar manner.

However, seeing the other party's demeanor, Li Qi immediately understood Ah Du's meaning.

Ah Du spoke very politely, even somewhat fawningly. But Li Qi was a smart man; he knew this traveling merchant wanted to tell him about the taboos and experiences of the road. It was just that because they weren't familiar yet, he was afraid Li Qi might be unhappy, so he used this phrasing as a substitute.

This man really knew how to conduct himself; no wonder he dared to seek a travel companion in the wild.

"Alright. I indeed do not go out often; tell me about them." Li Qi answered immediately, simultaneously placing his own saucer of rice cakes together with the other's, gesturing for them to eat together.

This counted as acceptance.

Ah Du did not stand on ceremony. He picked up a piece of rice cake, poured himself a cup of tea, and began to speak.

"Speaking of traveling as a merchant out here, from time to time one encounters mountain spirits and wild monsters. It's just that humans are different from mountain spirits and wild monsters. Humans are the spiritual leaders of all living things; we are born with the Pre-Heaven Three Treasures. These are things those creatures cannot obtain even if they beg, so if they are ordinary spirits, they dare not touch us."

The Pre-Heaven Three Treasures—hearing this term again, Li Qi pricked up his ears and began to listen carefully.

"The Pre-Heaven Three Treasures are our human Spirit, Qi, and Essence. These are things possessed only by those born with spiritual wisdom. Demon things, which cultivate intelligence later in life, cannot obtain them!"

Qi!

Li Qi heard a familiar term again.
