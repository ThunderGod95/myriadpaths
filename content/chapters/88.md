# Chapter 88: Underhanded Tactics

Bao Dun sat in his room, stroking the golden-furred mouse.

_The metal qi hasn't moved since it entered the room. Is he asleep?_ Bao Dun thought, sensing the aura.

_Could he have left the weapon in the room and run off?_

Unlikely.

The other party was a martial artist. To a martial artist, a weapon was a second life.

This was why Bao Dun had not rashly demanded the saber upon seeing the man.

Weapons were truly of the utmost importance to martial artists. Bringing up such a request was as deeply offensive as asking a man to hand over his wife.

Yet, Bao Dun had no intention of giving up that blade.

"Such pure metal qi, and laced with baleful qi to boot. It is truly a magnificent tonic," he muttered, stroking the mouse's fur with immense greed.

His cultivation method centered around taming this golden-furred creature.

He first had to cultivate a Martial Dao cultivation method to temper his own internal qi. Then, he would blend and refine the external metal qi with his internal qi to feed the mouse.

The stronger this Gold-Seeking Mouse became, the stronger he grew. Once the Gold-Seeking Mouse completely shed its mortal form, he would gain an innate, variant external avatar and advance to Rank 7. He could even maintain his human form while possessing the power of a metal-attribute spirit beast.

It was wonderfully profound.

This was the very reason he had joined the Mount Bo Sect. He cultivated the Martial Dao while scouring the land for enough metal qi to feed this Gold-Seeking Mouse.

Ordinary metals contained far too little metal qi; even pure gold lacked a sufficient amount.

Only hundred-refined steel, ranked dharma treasures, divine weapons, or natural treasures of the metal attribute were of any real use.

Therefore, it was absolutely impossible for him to let that Rank 9 long saber slip through his fingers.

_If this young man has simply fallen asleep, that makes things easy. When the midnight hour arrives, I will sneak over and kill him._

_If he is awake, I will end the battle swiftly. The Gold-Seeking Mouse suppresses metal-attribute weapons. Caught by a sneak attack, he stands no chance against me._

_If he chooses to abandon his blade and come after me... that would be even better. An unarmed martial artist is nothing but clay waiting to be molded._

Bao Dun calculated the possibilities, feeling utterly secure in his impending victory.

Besides, his target was young and likely lacked deep foresight. It was entirely normal for him to just go straight to sleep.

This youth hailed from a tracker gang and had merely lucked into finding a master's sect. He wouldn't have the worldly experience to consider every angle, entirely incomparable to an old Jianghu hand like himself.

As for the possibility that his Martial Dao cultivation was faked?

Impossible.

The youth's breathing was prolonged and his vitality was boundless. It was obvious his internal organs had been thoroughly refined. Furthermore, the refinement method was exceedingly brilliant, leaving behind no hidden injuries or impurities. A Rank 9 cultivator could never achieve such a flawless state alone.

Bao Dun specialized in observing metal qi, and since the lungs governed the metal element, he could directly perceive lung qi. This young man's lung qi was deep and razor-sharp, proving the tempering technique used on him was nothing short of miraculous. It was impossible for the youth to have refined his organs himself; an elder from his sect must have intervened to help.

He was undoubtedly at Rank 9 of the Martial Dao.

As long as the boy walked the Martial Dao, he was perfectly countered. It was impossible for a martial artist to fight without a weapon.

So-called fist arts and leg techniques were merely foundational prerequisites for wielding arms. A Martial Dao cultivation method would inevitably rely on a weapon.

He had seen many Martial Dao sects. Some boasted of peerless fist arts, but their empty-handed forms were born entirely from spear techniques. The fist art was the spear art; without a spear, their combat prowess was cut in half.

Thus, he was filled with confidence.

A Rank 9 Martial Dao cultivator was destined to be swallowed whole by him.

He only needed to confirm the situation before making his move.

With this thought, he maintained his vigilance over all surrounding metal qi while specifically monitoring the metal qi of that long saber.

Suddenly, however, he sensed something was wrong.

_Hmm? Movement downstairs? What is happening?_

From the lower deck of the pleasure boat, he felt a chaotic flurry of metal qi darting about. Were the drunk disciples roughhousing and sparring with one another?

"Is now the time to be trading blows? Honestly..." He shook his head, preparing to head downstairs and reprimand the disciples.

Bao Dun did not suspect that the Rank 9 martial artist had come knocking.

He was well aware of the capabilities of the Martial Dao. If the youth had truly come unarmed and engaged the disciples below, the ensuing battle would have caused a massive commotion, even if the disciples were outmatched. It wouldn't feel like a mere sparring session, let alone one occurring in near silence.

This was the conclusion he drew from sensing the metal qi.

Pushing open his door and stepping into the corridor, he saw no one.

This was normal. The cultivation method of the Mount Bo Sect required asceticism. This did not mean lifelong celibacy, but rather retaining one's vital essences during active cultivation; otherwise, all efforts would be wasted. Roughly two-thirds of the year was dedicated to this active cultivation period, with rest only permitted during the winter.

It was currently spring. Fearing the young disciples might succumb to their surging youthful passions, the sect had already driven away the usual patrons and completely bought out the pleasure boat, leaving only the kitchen staff behind.

He reached the second floor and opened the door.

The instant he stepped inside, his hair stood on end like a startled hedgehog! Metal qi erupted wildly, and the surrounding floorboards instantly shattered, sliced into ribbons!

Without hesitation, he squeezed the Gold-Seeking Mouse, igniting all of his internal qi and metal qi. The two qi transformed into invisible blades that swept out in every direction!

Within a thirty-foot radius, everything was reduced to dust!

Because he saw them. Dozens of corpses lay strewn across the entire second floor.

There was no bleeding...

No, rather, there were no external wounds. Every single person had died bleeding from their seven facial orifices.

Was it damage to the divine soul? Or something else?

What Daoist Tradition could strike directly at the divine soul? Was it a curse? Or the soul-snatching arts of the Daoist Sects?

But none of that mattered.

What mattered was that he was in massive trouble!

By erupting with this torrent of metal qi, he could guarantee that absolutely no one at or below Rank 9 could get near him.

The metal qi swirling around him acted as a storm of flying razors. Though it lacked the sheer destructive force of the initial outburst, it remained a persistent, deadly barrier that could not be underestimated.

His confidence in handling the Martial Dao stemmed not just from his ability to counter metal qi, but also from the fact that most martial artists relied on close-quarters combat. The moment anyone stepped within thirty feet of him, he would ensure their flesh was shredded and their bones snapped!

Yet at this moment, this thirty-foot domain of metal qi provided him no comfort whatsoever.

The floor had been carved to pieces. He fell from the second floor of the pleasure boat down to the first. His metal qi domain scraped against the lower deck, emitting a harsh, grating screech. Wooden planks were constantly pulverized, surrounding furniture was cleaved apart, and fabrics were slashed to ribbons. Nothing that drew close could escape destruction.

_Where? Where is it?_

_The thing capable of harming the divine soul! Where is it?!_

_Where is it hiding?_

_Who is it? That Rank 9 martial artist surnamed Li? Is he not a martial artist? Impossible!_

_He is clearly a Rank 9 martial artist. I couldn't possibly be wrong!_

Raising his vigilance to its absolute peak, he gripped the Gold-Seeking Mouse—the source of half his cultivation base—in his palm and dedicated all his focus to searching for any potential enemy.

_Metal qi... right, metal qi!_

That man surnamed Li possessed an unusually terrifying degree of lung refinement. His every breath would inevitably carry pure lung qi. As the lungs belonged to the metal element, Bao Dun could faintly perceive it!

_Yes, I just need to track that._

He poured all his concentration into tracking the lung qi riding on the enemy's breath.

_Found it!_

He sensed a faint trace of lung qi and snapped his gaze in that direction.

There, a blood-drenched human head was tossed into the air. Its eyes bulged outward, half-popped from their sockets.

At that exact same moment, a long whip tore through the air from directly behind him.
