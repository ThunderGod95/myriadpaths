# Chapter 10: Assault

What is going on?!

How are there a dozen men missing?

Getting lost might happen to two or three, but how could ten or twenty people get lost?

"Look sharp, something's wrong!" he immediately turned back to look at the trackers, shouting loudly, no longer even paying attention to concealment!

But almost at the same time.

The air emitted a muffled thunderclap.

A boulder exceeding three hundred kilograms came smashing out from a dark corner at extreme speed. The speed was so fast that the air itself let out a dull, heavy sound!

Then, it smashed directly into the crowd!

_Crack, crack, crack, crack_—a burst of sounds of tendons snapping and bones breaking, as if they had been hit by a catapult.

Wailing covered the ground; in an instant, four or five people were spurting blood from their mouths, clearly not going to survive, while about ten others were affected, sustaining injuries of various sizes.

"Form formation!" Lu Shan roared immediately, then he himself lunged out fiercely, rushing toward the place where the stone had been thrown.

And immediately, another stone came whistling in!

Lu Shan met it from the flank, and in the nick of time, he kicked it, knocking the stone askew from the side so that it smashed into the ground.

The trackers also reacted immediately from their previous dazed state.

Then, according to what Lu Shan had taught them, they formed groups of ten, with the extras standing in the back, composing a strange formation.

And Lu Shan rushed over, shoving aside a thin wall made of wooden planks.

Then, he saw a man more than eight feet tall, so muscular he didn't look human, but rather like his muscles had been inflated.

He had never seen anyone so muscular.

The main point was that, through the faint ambient light, he vaguely saw the other party's face.

It was Li Qi.

Why is Li Qi here?!

And how did he turn into this appearance?! Wasn't he only seven feet tall? His physique could only be described as well-proportioned; when did he become so muscular?!

However, Li Qi, seeing Lu Shan enter, grinned and spoke up, "Big Strong Shan, surprised?"

Lu Shan was stunned.

Next, Li Qi took advantage of the other party being distracted by his words to launch a direct sneak attack.

With a barbaric ox charge, he slammed directly into Lu Shan, sending him flying.

But to Li Qi's surprise, this sudden sneak attack actually didn't work!

Two burly men collided, yet Li Qi felt the point of impact was light and airy, completely lacking the sensation of a solid hit.

But Lu Shan flew high up and retreated far back, borrowing this force to retreat backward. He rolled twice to dissipate the force, then stood up and returned within the tracker formation.

Next, he looked at Li Qi.

In a flash of sparks and stone, Lu Shan had already figured out the situation.

Missing a dozen men... they were probably ambushed and taken by Li Qi on the way, right?

That force just now was likely upwards of three thousand kilograms; even he was far inferior.

_Spell art, this is absolutely a spell art!_

_It's probably the one that was supposed to be mine!_

"Li Qi is right there! Kill him!" he roared at the top of his voice, even cracking. "Use what I taught you! We have twenty-odd people, he is only one!"

Then, Lu Shan took the lead and launched a charge, leading dozens of men rushing toward Li Qi.

As for Li Qi's side.

Everything was still within his plan.

Lu Shan sending people to kill him tonight already spoke volumes.

So, he had unhesitatingly feigned injury, yet deliberately leaked the fact that he was still alive.

Lu Shan would not tolerate him living on; he would definitely bring the men of the Strong Force Gang to kill his way over.

One could imagine with their toes how much was at stake with a spell art. The authorities could usually suppress the conflicts between the three gangs, but with a spell art hanging over their heads, the authorities would no longer be able to keep them in check.

Besides, the Strong Force Gang was strong to begin with.

The Strong Force Gang had always been the strongest of the three gangs, and Lu Shan had always been ambitious and watched them like a tiger.

Plus, he had a clear head and was strong himself. Before Li Qi arrived, the Wave-Rowing Gang's days had been hard, and the Water Horse Gang wasn't comfortable either. It was just that there were two gangs, and by joining hands, they could balance him out a bit.

They hadn't been flattened purely because the Wave-Rowing Gang could go underwater—once in the water, the Strong Force Gang could do nothing to them—while the Water Horse Gang was thick-skinned and fleshy. Although they had no offensive capability, their self-preservation was more than sufficient.

After Li Qi came, he saw through Lu Shan's schemes several times, which was how he was able to become the number two figure in the Wave-Rowing Gang.

So regarding what Lu Shan would do and his character, Li Qi believed he understood very well.

Lu Shan would not sit and wait for death, nor wait for him to slowly comprehend the divine will inheritance.

Even more, he wouldn't wait until the next day, because by the next day, Li Qi might have run away.

Lu Shan might think that he would hide, slowly comprehend the spell art, and then return after learning it, whereupon he would have the capital to continue the standoff.

So, Li Qi concluded, Lu Shan would definitely act decisively, striking directly while he still knew Li Qi's location to avoid long nights fraught with dreams.

So, there was what Li Qi had said—strike first to gain the upper hand.

Lu Shan would act decisively? And he wouldn't?

He had mastered the Ox Strength Art!

So, he had infiltrated the Strong Force Gang's camp ahead of time through the Li River tributary.

Originally, he prepared for a night raid to behead Lu Shan.

But unexpectedly, he happened to run into Lu Shan leading the team out to attack.

Then the rest of the matter followed logically. He stealthily followed behind, occasionally grabbing a straggler suddenly and twisting their neck directly.

Under the Ox Strength Art, it guaranteed not even a second was needed, and not half a sound would be emitted, just like wringing a chick's neck to death.

He followed for over ten minutes; he had used the Ox Strength Art for the second opportunity, and renewed it for the third, silently killing a dozen people.

The third time; this was the last opportunity today, and also the last ten minutes.

So, Li Qi decided to actively attack here. He found two stones and struck first to steal the initiative, killing four or five in a sneak attack before being discovered!

Seeing the other side go from forty-odd people to only twenty-something, reduced by almost half, Li Qi revealed a ferocious grin. Two white columns of steam puffed from his nostrils, exceptionally conspicuous in the winter air, and combined with his crimson skin, he was terrifying beyond compare.

Seeing Lu Shan still daring to take the lead and charge over, Li Qi launched a counter-charge without hesitation!

Like a barbaric ox, every step he took stomped cracks into the ground, making a rumbling sound!

Where did they get the gall to charge head-on against him?

The current him had thick skin, was invulnerable to swords and spears—daggers couldn't even pierce him—and his strength possessed the power of one ox, a full three thousand four hundred kilograms of brute force, which was enough to easily lift a small car!

In Li Qi's self-perception, he felt that this single collision of his could at least smash through two layers of heavy hide.

Such force, when rushing violently, shook the resolve of the trackers before him, and they couldn't hold back the fear in the depths of their hearts.

But, they suddenly discovered that their charge couldn't stop.

As if there was a rope, through some kind of formation, tethering their bodies and forcing them to form a whole, leading them under Lu Shan's command to crash into the barbaric ox before their eyes with the spirit of crushed bodies and shattered bones!
