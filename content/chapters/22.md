# Chapter 22: Idle Talk

The group rested for half an hour, and everyone except Li Qi had recovered.

Although Li Qi was still a bit exhausted, he managed to force himself to perk up; at a glance, he seemed to have recovered too.

But only he could feel that he was actually still a bit weak. It was like the feeling after doing two hundred frog jumps and resting for a while: he seemed recovered and could walk and run, but his inner thighs were still trembling.

The group of traveling merchants also came up one by one to greet Li Qi, getting chummy and calling him "strongman," "warrior," "real man," and other such praises, expressing their gratitude.

Li Qi didn't act aloof; he smiled and exchanged pleasantries with them. After all, everyone had worked together last night to overcome the crisis, so they could be considered to have shared a life-and-death experience.

If not for the weapon array formed by those choppers, Li Qi reckoned he would have been finished off by the black mist in two or three moves.

Even with the weapon array, without Ba Kui going up to fight desperately alongside him, he probably would have been done for.

It could only be said that last night was truly good luck.

Having overcome a crisis together, their relationship naturally became closer.

When the sky grew slightly bright and everyone's strength had returned, they chopped wood and made a fire. They threw in dried rice cakes made of spirit rice to boil, added salt and wild vegetables they found, and made a pot of rice cake soup. The group gathered around the fire, drinking soup and chatting, happily.

"Li Qi, this really is fate. If we hadn't happened to bump into each other, and happened to meet again at night, both our groups would probably have been in mortal danger. But since we met, we turned bad luck into good! Hahaha." A merchant raised his bowl, drank a mouthful of soup, and chewed on the softened rice cake, laughing.

"Yes, it really was luck," Li Qi agreed, then took a sip as well.

These rice cakes were as hard as stone when dry, but became soft and glutinous like New Year cake after boiling. With the wild vegetables, they were truly fragrant, much tastier than what he usually ate.

While he was agreeing, Ah Du sat over.

"Brother Li, that woman still hasn't woken up. Are you really planning to carry her to Feng County? Even if you do, and she still doesn't wake up, will you hire a doctor for her? Who pays for that? And even if you hire a doctor, if she isn't saved and dies, you might end up being investigated for murder. It's not worth it," Ah Du said to Li Qi.

"What else can I do? Leave her now and wait for her to die?" Li Qi rubbed his temples in distress, feeling a headache coming on.

Didn't he know what Ah Du was saying?

Saving people meant inviting a pile of trouble. Once in the city, he'd have to explain to the guards what was wrong with her. If she didn't wake up, he'd have to treat her. If he couldn't treat her and just abandoned her, he'd be accused of murder.

Besides, even if the woman woke up, would he still take care of her? If so, would he have to find her family? What about her daily needs? Her clothes were tattered, so she obviously needed a change, and clothes weren't a small expense—at least twenty or thirty coins.

And if he didn't take care of her and abandoned her on the streets, what difference was there from killing her? It was all too normal for a weak, solitary woman to be abducted by thieves.

"If you ask me, just leave her here to fend for herself. Pretend we never saved her. We risked our lives to pull her out of the demon's hands; that's already saving her life once. If she dies again, she can't blame us," Ah Du suggested to Li Qi.

The other merchants nodded in agreement, supporting Ah Du's view.

"Brother Ah Du is sensible. When traveling, don't look for trouble."

"We've already saved her life; she should be grateful to us. She can't bite the hand that feeds her and cause us trouble, right? We're all suffering people, why make things hard for each other?"

"Exactly. Brother Li, you're out alone in the middle of winter; one look and we know you have big business to attend to. How can you be dragged down by this woman?"

The merchants spoke one after another, making it sound serious, as if taking the woman along would make it impossible to move a single step.

However, the leader of the merchants, the burly man named Ba Kui, looked repeatedly at the woman and suddenly smiled. "Haha, Li Qi, don't tell me you're not married yet?"

As soon as these words were spoken, the chattering merchants all shut their mouths.

Including Ah Du, everyone's faces revealed a subtle smile.

Some who didn't understand or react in time saw their companions' expressions and suddenly realized, showing the same look.

"I see this woman has a pretty face and a fine figure. Her skin is smooth, without calluses or scars, so she probably hasn't done rough work. Such a woman looks good, but isn't one for daily life. Brother Li Qi, don't be blinded by lust. Marrying this kind of woman is only temporary happiness, but you'll suffer for the rest of your life," Ba Kui said in a sage-like tone, as if speaking from vast experience.

"That's right, Li Qi. This woman looks pretty, but her hips are narrow and her waist is thin. She looks like she'd have a hard birth. Besides, this kind of woman can't carry or lift anything and can't help with housework. Even if she has a child, how will she manage? You can't be busy at home all the time and ignore the outside, right? Who will earn money then?"

"I think so too. Even in the best-case scenario, if this woman learns to work, within two years of working, she'll become just like my wife—ugly face, thick waist. And if she's not even good at working and needs to be taught everything, that's a real loss!" Someone slapped his thigh and evaluated.

"Exactly. If you really crave that smooth skin, there are plenty of brothels in the city. Just go there when you have the urge; why keep one at home? She can't do anything and can't help with the livelihood."

The merchants chattered away, their words painting a vivid and convincing picture.

"Actually, I think Brother Li is exactly the kind of man who deserves a woman like this," Ah Du said suddenly, offering a different perspective.

"Although we've only been together for two days, Brother Li acts with courage and strategy, is organized and methodical, and is capable. He knows spell arts and doesn't bully others with his strength. If you ask me, he'll definitely make money and buy some property in the future. Will finding a few servants to serve him be difficult then? Will he still be afraid of a pretty wife getting ugly from rough work?" Ah Du drank his soup and said with a grin.

"Haha, Ah Du really knows how to talk!"

"What do you mean 'knows how to talk'? I think Brother Li Qi is someone who will do big things!"

The merchants also chimed in, but it was obviously flattery. They were saying nice things, but without the sincerity they had before.

As for Li Qi, he didn't know whether to laugh or cry.

What were these people thinking... he just picked up a woman by the roadside, how did it suddenly turn into him marrying her?
