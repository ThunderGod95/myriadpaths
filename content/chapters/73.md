# Chapter 73: Ghost Qi

After the meal, Li Qi and Patriarch Wang set out.

Along the way, Patriarch Wang trembled whenever he looked at Li Qi. He didn't dare speak, merely carrying the items Li Qi had requested while leading the way in front.

But Li Qi had no intention of making the journey in stifling silence.

"Patriarch Wang," he called out, initiating the conversation.

"Master Li!" Patriarch Wang jolted, his fatty flesh quivering. He wiped off a layer of cold sweat, hurriedly came to a halt, and turned to look at Li Qi.

"You're sweating profusely. It must be tiring carrying all that. Let me take it." Li Qi reached out to take the woven basket from the man's back.

Patriarch Wang subconsciously tried to dodge, stammering, "No need, no need..."

However, he was no cultivator. How could he possibly evade the grasp? Li Qi deftly snatched the basket and slung it over his own shoulders. He laughed and said, "I have a strong, sturdy body. Carrying a few dozen pounds feels like nothing at all. Why fight me for it?"

"True... true. M-many thanks, Master Li." Patriarch Wang offered an obsequious smile, still paralyzed by nerves.

_No kidding. This is an expert even my mother acknowledges._

In Patriarch Wang's eyes, his mother was already a fairy-like figure capable of predicting the future. Yet, she had to address this young man—who was younger than himself—as 'Senior Brother.'

How could he not be terrified?

Grabbing onto the young man's leg to stop him from leaving back then had exhausted every ounce of courage he possessed.

"By the way, Patriarch Wang, what do the surroundings of that tomb look like?" Li Qi asked.

Since the topic concerned the survival of his entire family, Patriarch Wang didn't dare withhold information. He hurriedly replied, "My mother said that the terrain there possesses a layout where 'mountains approach and waters loop, bestowing nobility, longevity, and wealth.' It boasts a landscape with 'lustrous soil, lush vegetation, a complete and dense hall layout, and a form where power gathers and stops.'[^1] It can be considered a supreme plot of land, imbued with the power of creation and nurturing."

"Hmm... according to that description, the person buried there should have reincarnated long ago. Why is their soul still imprisoned in the tomb, denied the cycle of reincarnation?" Li Qi questioned in return.

Logically speaking, a person would reincarnate seven days after death. Even if they refused to leave, the Yin Bailiffs would forcefully escort them away.

The only exception was if they harbored an immense grievance and wished to remain. The Yin Bailiffs might take pity on the injustice they suffered and grant them a brief period to exact their revenge.

Alternatively, the deceased might possess profound cultivation. Even though their physical body was dead, the Yin Bailiffs dispatched by the Nether Court to apprehend them would immediately turn tail and flee at the mere sight of them. Forget capturing the soul; the bailiffs would be burning incense in gratitude as long as the soul didn't capture _them_.

However, according to the old matriarch, the cultivator buried within was only at Rank Eight.

Rank Eight was powerful, but far from sufficient to resist the Yin Bailiffs.

The tomb's layout was extraordinarily auspicious and capable of dissipating resentment. What kind of monumental grievance could possibly endure such natural purification? Or was there some other insidious trickery at play within the tomb?

"T-that, I wouldn't know. Unlike Master Li and my mother, who possess mental energy, I am nothing but a mortal..." Patriarch Wang smiled bitterly.

Li Qi nodded, accepting his reasoning, and fell into silent contemplation.

First, he touched his waist. The willow branch tied there like a belt was carried with him at all times, never leaving his side. It was a sharp weapon against ghosts.

Next, he weighed the cloth-wrapped long saber in his hand. It was saturated with baleful qi and military qi, making it incomparably ferocious.

Finally, he took a deep breath. He inhaled for a full minute before stopping.

Because his lungs had been tempered by water qi, his breathing was long and drawn out, his stamina abundant, and he would not easily fall short of breath.

He had also reviewed the methods for dealing with ghosts the night before. Shen Shuibi had declared him good to go, so there would definitely be no problems.

Chatting about minor details along the way, both soon arrived outside the city. After passing the terraced fields of a village, they stepped into a region of winding mountains and rivers.

Baiyue was a mountainous region, earning the moniker of the 'Hundred Thousand Mountains.' Very little of the land was flat, to the point that even agricultural fields had to be carved into terraces or slopes. Thus, this particular stretch of mountains didn't look exceptionally out of the ordinary.

However, upon closer inspection, one could see the landscape converging. Though the terrain was steep and perilous, the grand mountains swept downward like a dancing dragon. Where they met the flatlands, a confluence of waters gathered in front, forming what was known as 'descending mountain water.'

Of course, Li Qi had no idea what use any of this was.

Yet, when Li Qi observed it through qi perspective, things changed.

The soil was lustrous and the vegetation lush, representing the beauty of the earth and birthing a harmonizing qi. The terrain rose and fell, possessing subtle connections even where broken. Its qi was therefore abundant, culminating in the fullness of auspicious gathered qi.

It was like a vessel holding its contents, full to the brim but overflowing, reflecting the gathering and settling of qi.

The mountain qi at the earth's roots and the qi of the water veins converged here, giving birth to a surging vitality.

It had to be said, even if Li Qi didn't know how to appraise landscapes, he could sense that this was an incredible fengshui treasure land.

"My mother said that the mountains and rivers here align with the Five Elements, producing positions of authority and prosperity. The source runs deep and distant, governing wealth and flourishing fortunes. That is why this place was chosen..." Patriarch Wang explained.

"Mhm. Still, let's set up the altar first. Stand a bit further back. If an accident happens, it'll be easier for you to run," Li Qi instructed.

Patriarch Wang scampered off immediately. He had genuinely witnessed 'accidents' before and was absolutely terrified.

Li Qi, meanwhile, began erecting the altar.

Ancient texts stated: The people of Yue hold customs revering ghosts, and ghosts are always seen at their shrines; these methods are frequently effective.

This meant that the Yue people worshipped ghosts and deities, regularly encountering them during their sacrificial rites. This method was often proven to work.

But what exactly was a ghost?

As an Invocator, Li Qi was well aware that ghosts were simply another form of qi.

The [Book of Invocation] recorded: "When falling stars are seen in the sky, they are true falling stars; when not true stars, it is qi taking their form. When people see a ghost in the shape of a dead person, it is actually an phenomena gathered by qi, not the true dead person."

This meant that the streaks of light left by falling stars in the sky weren't always actual stars, but phenomena formed by qi. Similarly, when a person saw a ghost resembling the deceased, it was the qi shaping itself into that likeness, rather than the genuine appearance of the dead.

This was the meaning behind the saying: "The dead cannot borrow the forms of the living to appear, just as the living cannot borrow the souls of the dead to perish."

Once a person died, their flesh and skin decayed. Even if their essence qi persisted, how could their spirit borrow that rotted vessel to move and manifest? The dead could not appear using the bodies of the living, just as the living could not use the souls of the dead to erase their own physical forms.

There was another saying: "Humans are creatures; animals are also creatures. When animals die, they do not become ghosts. Why is it that only humans can become ghosts upon death?"

As the text stated: "Upon exhaustion, essence qi extinguish; upon extinguishing, the physical form decays; upon decay, it becomes dust and ash. When essence qi leave a person, is it merely the same as losing one's eyes and ears? Decay leads to dissipation, becoming formless and unseen. Hence, they are called ghosts and spirits."

This passage meant that ghosts were a manifestation of qi. Humans lived due to their essence qi. When they died, this essence qi extinguished, though other remnants might be left behind. When essence qi left the body, it wasn't simply akin to a person losing their senses. Rot led to dissipation, transforming into a vague, formless existence. Therefore, they were termed 'ghosts and spirits.'

Ghosts and humans were not equivalent. When a person died and became a ghost, they were no longer their original self. A ghost was nothing more than a mass of remains, a pile of ashes.

Therefore, even if a mighty figure with profound cultivation persisted after death, retaining their consciousness and memories, they were fundamentally a different entity from what they once were.

Dead meant dead. The ghost was no longer the original person.

[^1]: In _feng shui_, rich, slightly damp, and colorful soil, along with thriving plants, are physical proof that active, life-giving Sheng Qi (Vital Energy) is flowing through the earth. Dead or dry land would indicate stagnant or "dead" qi.

    The "hall" refers to the Ming Tang (明堂), or "Bright Hall." This is the open space immediately in front of the grave.
    
    For a site to be "complete and dense," it must be perfectly enclosed by surrounding landforms—usually hills or mountains representing the Azure Dragon on the left and the White Tiger on the right. This horseshoe-like enclosure protects the tomb from harsh winds that would blow the qi away.
