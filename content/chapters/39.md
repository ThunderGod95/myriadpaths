# Chapter 39: Departure

Great Deer Kingdom, Li Prefecture, Feng County.

Inside a dilapidated roadside tavern.

"Haha! Satisfying!" Ba Kui shouted loudly, downing the rice wine in his cup in one gulp.

That's right, it was still rice.

When it came down to it, rice was the cheapest and most abundant commodity. Since there was enough spirit rice anyway, making wine naturally used rice as well.

Drinking this stuff, Li Qi always felt it wasn't like white liquor, but more like fermented sweet rice lees...

It barely had the taste of alcohol; it was sweet and quite tasty.

It counted as a beverage, not really as wine.

Was it because brewing high-proof liquor or distilled liquor would consume too much fuel, so they chose this low-alcohol fermented wine?

After all, fuel was much more expensive than rice.

Maybe rice could be used as fuel?

Would it even burn?

Li Qi let his thoughts wander wildly while picking up a side dish and tasting it deliciously.

It wasn't any impressive dish, just sour pickled radish stir-fried with minced meat, but such ordinary fare made Li Qi feel it was incomparably delicious, and he ate with great relish.

"Brother Ba Kui, regarding your trip to Lianxia this time, what business are you planning to do?" Li Qi did not drink much, focusing instead on the flavor of the pickled radish.

Why had he never found pickled radish so delicious before? The salty taste was simply divine.

After eating nothing but plain rice for so long, his mouth tasted of absolutely nothing. Li Qi truly cherished the chance to eat something with a stronger flavor.

"Helping someone deliver a batch of goods. They say... it's some gemstones, but I reckon they aren't worth much. I heard people say those gemstones cost tens of thousands of coins for just a small piece, and the beautiful ones cost dozens of gold for a single small bead, expensive enough to scare people to death. But the ones we're carrying, everyone has a piece, and even the small ones are three or four hundred catties! Added together it's five or six thousand catties; what gemstone could have this much quantity?" Ba Kui said with a grin.

"But our trip to Lianxia this time isn't that far anyway. Brother Li Qi, what do you do? Running out alone right at the start of spring, and your luggage is just a bundle; you don't look like a traveling merchant. Are you out to deliver a message entrusted by someone?" Ba Kui asked.

While speaking, he also picked up a piece of sour radish and put it in his mouth to savor.

Aside from the sour radish with minced meat, there was also a saucer of salted vegetable braised pork and a basket of steamed rice cakes; this was the cuisine and staple food for their banquet.

It could hardly be called a feast, but for Li Qi, it was certainly a rare delicacy. It probably hadn't been cheap for Ba Kui either. It was clear that while the sturdy man might not be a good person, he was definitely a magnanimous one.

That he wasn't a good person was obvious; Li Qi estimated that Ba Kui had certainly done his fair share of killing and robbing.

His magnanimity was demonstrated by his current actions. Li Qi had shared life and death with him, barging through demons together, so even if they didn't understand each other well, Ba Kui treated Li Qi as a friend and was very sincere.

"It's not exactly a glorious reason either; I offended someone back home and came out to flee from disaster," Li Qi admitted, though he bent the truth slightly. "That fellow bullied people too far and was always thinking of seizing my family property. I killed him, so I fled."

"Excellent! You’re just the kind of man I like! If anyone dares to bully us, they deserve to be run through with a blade! No one gets to look down on us men! Let's drink to that!" Ba Kui seemed particularly fond of such stories, raising his wine cup to toast with Li Qi.

Li Qi clinked cups with him and took a sip.

Then, he saw Ba Kui, while praising him, draw the chopper from his waist, brandishing it triumphantly.

Almost instantly, Li Qi felt a stinging pain in his eyes!

Qi!

Inside Ba Kui's chopper, there was a piercing qi.

It was red and extremely vicious. Li Qi could even feel the fine hairs on his skin stand on end, as if a blade were making tentative passes across his face.

"Brother Ba Kui, that chopper of yours?" he asked, forcing himself to endure the chilling sensation washing over him and feigning a casual tone.

That night, when he and Ba Kui had fought the wild dog demon, he had noticed a faint red glow on the weapon. He had dismissed it at the time, confident that it couldn’t possibly penetrate his thick hide.

After all, the hide granted by the Ox Strength Art was practically impervious to blades and spears.

However, at this moment, he could detect the sharpness of that chopper.

*What kind of qi is that?!*

*Is this a dharma artifact like my willow branch? Has some kind of qi been infused into the chopper, granting it a unique trait?*

*My willow branch is infused with an Earthly Divinity's divine qi. But what is this?*

"What about my chopper?" Ba Kui asked, looking puzzled. Why did Li Qi seem so… frail?

As if he was afraid of something.

"How many things has that blade of yours cut?" Li Qi asked, having finally managed to compose himself.

"Haha! You asked the right person. This chopper is the tool I eat with; going up and down the mountains, chopping wood and chopping beasts, it’s all thanks to this fellow. Speaking of which, it's strange too; other people's blades go blunt after a few uses, but this one of mine, it just gets sharper the more I use it. I’ve lost count of how many pigs and rabbits it's killed. Chopping trees, cutting meat, there’s nothing it can’t do," he said proudly, tapping the flat of the blade with a series of sharp raps.

Then, he leaned in conspiratorially. "It’s even tasted a good deal of human blood."

Then, he sat back. "Even the Spirit Medium in my hometown said that this blade is no longer an ordinary chopper. There is baleful qi inside, and ghosts will retreat upon seeing it. I rely entirely on this to travel north and south!"

Listening to his boasting, Li Qi looked thoughtfully at that chopper.

So, this kind of qi was called baleful qi?

Judging from the description, it shouldn't come from any ritual or cultivation; the source of baleful qi... should be killing.

Killing people, killing wild beasts, killing living things.

Perhaps not just living things; killing the dead probably worked too, like killing ghosts or zombies.

All in all, Li Qi made a mental note of the source of this qi.

Maybe he could get a bit of it to increase his own strength.

After all, this didn't look too difficult; never mind killing people, killing more pigs shouldn't be a problem, right?

With that thought, the meal came to an end. Neither man was drunk; they both possessed bodies enhanced by cultivation methods and wouldn't be intoxicated by this kind of rice wine, though their bellies were stuffed from eating.

Rice cakes accompanied by salted vegetables and sour radish, plus some minced meat or braised pork, allowed the two brawny men to eat to their hearts' content.

"Well then, Brother Li Qi, we'll meet again if fate allows; I'll be going first!" Ba Kui said his farewell, shouldered his large basket, paid the bill, and prepared to set off for Lianxia.

Li Qi watched the other party leave, then turned around himself, walking toward the inn.

As he walked, his speed became faster and faster, turning from a walk into a trot, and then into a sprint!

It was already noon; Shen Shuibi should have woken up too.

Then it was time to depart, to find Lady Luofu!

Li Qi clenched his fists, quickening his pace.

If he found this person, maybe there would be unexpected gains!

New spell arts, new power; only then could he truly stand up *there*.
