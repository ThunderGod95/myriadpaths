# Chapter 33: Pursuasion

In the dead of night.

On the street.

Two people.

Li Qi and Shen Shuibi stared at each other, one looking at the other.

Li Qi was completely baffled. He had been waiting for Young Master Zhu to make introductions, and then he could properly open his mouth to introduce himself. The two sides could get to know each other, and only then would it be good to hit the road!

What was wrong with his new boss? He just showed up, asked a few questions, dumped a person on him, and left?!

This boss was a bit irresponsible... Or was it that he wasn't the only candidate chosen to find Lady Luofu? Was the Young Master busy arranging for other backups?

No, maybe he was the backup.

However, Li Qi wasn't the only one bewildered; so was Shen Shuibi.

The rabbit demon's mind was a whirlwind of confusion, so much so that she forgot her earlier vigilance and animosity.

Huh? That detestable Grand Invocator just left?

He just left her and that equally detestable junior Invocator to go find the Lady?

Could he be following them?

These Invocators were all insidious. She had heard that everyone on Shaman God Mountain was a bit unhinged.

The Invocators were considered relatively normal, as they were the ones who usually handled external affairs.

The Diviners were said to be even more fanatical, constantly mumbling to themselves, using their arts to plot against others and themselves, and speaking so cryptically that others had to guess their meaning.

Besides these two main groups, the various other shamans were, in legend, all complete lunatics—the kind of shamaness who performed frenzied dances and often conversed with thin air, making them incredibly difficult to understand.

Shen Shuibi's brain was full of doubts.

However, it was still Li Qi who reacted relatively quickly. He took a step forward. "Miss Shen, do you still remember me? We even met during the day today."

"I know. You're that junior Shaman who came to secretly capture me!" Shen Shuibi said, her face full of caution.

She sized Li Qi up, carefully scrutinizing every detail.

His skin was brownish-black, likely often tanned by the sun, and was still a bit rough, not delicate. One look and she knew he was a person of the bottom layer, and presumably did rough work before.

His clothes... were also of poor quality, made of hemp cloth and worn thin in many places. The frayed areas were numerous, but it seemed he had no woman to help him, so there were no patches to be seen on the holes.

He looked truly pitiful.

His face... was actually quite handsome, with a heroic air that made him seem forthright and sincere.

Pah! How could this junior shaman be forthright? He was full of tricks and schemes. Listening to his conversation with the Grand Invocator, he was definitely a treacherous villain.

Li Qi could feel her scrutinizing gaze.

He straightened his back and spoke with righteous conviction, "Was our last meeting not a pure coincidence? Miss Shen, you were trapped by that demon, and we were the ones who saved you. After finding you, I let you go. How can you say I came to capture you? Can you slander me as you please simply because of your high status?"

"But after you came last time, that Grand Invocator showed up and captured me!" Shen Shuibi said, aggrieved and a little angry.

"How could a small pawn like me possibly know the plans of a Grand Invocator?" Li Qi gave a bitter smile. "In truth, I'm just as bewildered as you are!"

After saying this, Li Qi positioned himself on the same side as Shen Shuibi.

But before she could react, he quickly added, "However, Miss Shen, I don't think this is necessarily a bad thing."

"How is it not a bad thing? You people clearly have designs on the Lady!" Shen Shuibi fumed.

_Designs on the Lady... why does that sound so odd?_ Li Qi couldn't help but inwardly complain.

But he knew how to persuade people, so he immediately followed her line of thought. "Lady Luofu is being persecuted by the Tang Empire. I'm sure you are aware of this, Miss Shen?"

At the mention of this, Shen Shuibi fell silent, her expression visibly darkening with sorrow.

_This woman... she really has a one-track mind._

_But that's not so bad. It makes her easy to fool._

Li Qi thought this, yet his mouth did not stop, "Our Shaman God Mountain, however, stands with Lady Luofu. We are both enemies of the Tang Empire."

He was already speaking of "our Shaman God Mountain," though in reality, he had no idea what it even was. But a powerful backer was a powerful backer, and it was wise to hold on tight.

"Since we share a common enemy, you must know that the enemy of my enemy is my friend. Shaman God Mountain seeks Lady Luofu purely out of a desire to cooperate. To put the Lady's mind at ease, they even sent a small pawn like me as a messenger, ensuring no threat is posed to her. Furthermore, I am a person of the Outer Dao, so my location cannot be determined through divination. This should also reassure the Lady, as it's impossible to track her by tracking me."

"With such reassuring measures, does this not prove our sincerity?" Li Qi asked with genuine earnestness.

Was it truly sincere?

Of course not. It was all nonsense. If they truly wanted to play tricks, Li Qi was confident that Shaman God Mountain had ten thousand ways to do so.

But...

For someone not particularly sharp, a heap of justifications and reasons, topped off with a sincere tone, could easily win their trust.

It could be seen that Shen Shuibi was indeed moved.

Because it seemed... what Li Qi said, well, maybe, probably, perhaps, possibly... seemed to make some sense?

Seeing Shen Shuibi's confusion, Li Qi struck while the iron was hot, taking out the willow branch. "Miss Shen, please take a look at this. My status is low, and I've never handled any dharma artifacts. I don't know what the Young Master has given me. Since you are from Lady Luofu's side, you must surely know!"

Shen Shuibi was still pondering, and this sudden distraction made her subconsciously shift her attention to the willow branch.

Under Li Qi's sincere and pleading gaze, she found it hard to refuse...

So, she answered, "Uh, this should be a willow branch infused with the divine qi of an Earthly Divinity. It can ward off evil, has a binding effect, and can also be used to strike ghosts and wicked spirits."

"There are books that record... 'On the first day of the first lunar month, take a willow branch and place it above the door; a hundred ghosts will not enter the home'[^1]. I heard the Lady say that Tianzhu has a treasure called the Jade Vase, within which is inserted a willow branch, so the willow branch is an item for warding off evil[^2]; after being infused with the divine qi of an Earthly Divinity, its abilities are increased even more; I estimate it can even beat a person to death, but it's just so-so, not even qualified to be placed in the Lady's flower vase." Speaking of this, Shen Shuibi's tone became a little proud.

"I see. Miss Shen is truly knowledgeable and worldly-wise," Li Qi praised her. He genuinely didn't know any of this, so his admiration was sincere.

"Hmph!" Having been a fugitive for so long, Shen Shuibi seemed to finally be receiving some praise. She puffed out her chest, looking triumphant.

"Then let's find a place to rest for a bit. I would like to hear more from you, Miss Shen, to broaden my horizons. I'll be relying on your guidance on the road ahead," Li Qi said.

"But of course," Shen Shuibi replied politely.

However, she was completely unaware.

Just moments ago, she had not agreed to travel with Li Qi at all.

    The willow is one the first tress to sprout green leaves in early spring. In chinese cosmology, ghosts represent extreme _Yin_ (death/stagnation). The willow, bursting with early life, represents strong _Yang_ (vitality/growth). The two energies conflict, and the willow's vitality burns the Yin spirits.

[^2]: This refers to Guanyin (Avalokitesvara), the Bodhisattva of Compassion. In classic iconography (like in Journey to the West), Guanyin holds a Jade Vase (Yujingping) containing pure water, and she uses a Willow Branch to sprinkle this water to heal the world, exorcise demons, or bring the dead back to life.

    Btw, Tianzhu is ancient Chinese name for Indian subcontinent.
