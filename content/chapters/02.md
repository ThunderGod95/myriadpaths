# Chapter 2: Suspicions

"Ran into trouble? What's the situation?" Li Qi shook his head to cast aside his earlier distracting thoughts and looked closely at Sixth Uncle standing before him.

Sixth Uncle was a veteran of the Wave-Rowing Gang and a leader respected by everyone. He handled matters fairly, was warm-hearted, and possessed seasoned experience, earning him the unanimous trust of the others.

This man, in his forties, had hair that was already graying and a back that was severely hunched. Years of dragging boats had twisted his spine, and there was a distinct scar stretching from his neck down his back—clearly the result of tow ropes rubbing against his skin over long years.

Most elderly boat trackers shared these physical characteristics; the twisted spine was particularly conspicuous.

It was impossible not to develop some ailments when using one's flesh and blood to drag great ships weighing thousands of tons.

"After River Breaking concludes, there is a reward for the Lead Track. But wasn't the Strong Force Gang originally scheduled for the Lead Track?" Sixth Uncle asked.

"What use is 'originally scheduled'? River Breaking is already halfway done, and we've finished pulling the Lead Track. The Governor watched it with his own eyes; surely they can't snatch it back now? Even if they want revenge later, the Strong Force Gang's strength is on par with ours. Fighting for the Lead Track has always depended on skill, so what does it matter?" Li Qi didn't understand the concern.

If this counted as being targeted, then the various boat tracker gangs could be said to be targeting each other at all times and places.

It was a competitive relationship to begin with; everything just depended on one's own ability.

"Yes, it used to be like that. The Strong Force Gang doesn't have the ability to go to war with us just over losing one River Breaking event. However, news just came from our spies—not a single person from the Strong Force Gang came to watch the River Breaking ceremony today," Sixth Uncle said.

Hearing this, Li Qi furrowed his brows.

He sensed that something was wrong.

"We took the Lead Track, and the Water Horse Gang took the Second Track. There is no Third Track, but we will inevitably have people who exhaust their strength and leave vacancies that need filling. The Strong Force Gang surely has people who could fill in, yet not a single one came?" Li Qi rubbed his chin, muttering to himself.

According to custom, once one participated in River Breaking, even if it couldn't compare to the Lead or Second Tracks, there would still be rewards in the end. The Strong Force Gang had members in financial difficulty; by filling the spots of one or two injured or exhausted workers, at least a dozen people could have scrounged a share of the reward.

So in the past, when three gangs fought for the Lead Track, if one missed the Lead, they took the Second. If they missed the Second, most would still come over to join the bustle and try to snag a reward.

But now, not a single person from the Strong Force Gang had come?

No wonder Sixth Uncle had run over in such a hurry to discuss countermeasures with him.

When things go against the norm, there must be something amiss.

Thus, he clapped his hands. "Sixth Uncle, I won't go to the rotation later. I'm going to the Strong Force Gang's territory to take a look."

Sixth Uncle nodded. "That was my intention as well. You are smart, and you're good at fighting. You've also practiced the Wave-Shattering Force to proficiency, second only to me in the gang. I feel most at ease if you go."

Perhaps Li Qi really had a talent for martial arts. In any case, since obtaining the Wave-Shattering Force two years ago, he had become stronger than the majority of the gang members.

Coupled with a clever mind that had received an education, he had effectively become the number two figure in the Wave-Rowing Gang, second only to Sixth Uncle.

"Then I'll head over immediately." Li Qi was not one to procrastinate and stood up instantly.

"Be careful. Pay attention to safety; protecting yourself is the most important thing," Sixth Uncle urged.

"Don't worry." Li Qi nodded, then walked away quickly.

During the period of River Breaking, every household in Li Prefecture City was preparing supplies.

Merchants prepared goods, vendors prepared food; everyone was busy for the business that would follow the opening of the river.

After River Breaking, goods and merchants from many cities in the Great Deer Kingdom would gather in the prefectural city of Li Prefecture, using the Li River to transport shipments in all directions.

Therefore, River Breaking was the most important event of the year for Li Prefecture Prefecture, even more important than the New Year.

At this time, the entire city was busy with its own affairs, so apart from porters moving goods and couriers delivering messages, there were almost no idlers to be seen on the streets.

So when a person dressed as a boat tracker wandered through the city, many people cast strange glances his way.

However, most were merely curious, and no one came over to meddle.

They were too busy with their own affairs; why bother with a boat tracker?

Li Qi, on the other hand, wandered the streets for a while before suddenly blocking a small vendor setting up his stall. "Brother, why is everyone looking at me with such surprise?"

The vendor rolled his eyes and glanced at Li Qi. "You boat tracker, instead of trying to mooch off the Lead Track during River Breaking, you're wandering the streets. You tell me, why look at you?"

His speech was rather rude, as boat trackers could not compare to merchants.

Under the assembly of various wealthy businessmen, merchants had their own chambers of commerce. These chambers generally unified prices within their industries to stifle competition. The scissor makers had their guild, the blacksmiths had their guild, and even the porters and traveling merchants had organizations.

In this world, everyone banded together around a cultivation method to survive. Boat trackers, quite obviously, belonged to the lowest tier.

"So that's how it is. But aren't there many boat trackers on the street today? Why look only at me?" Li Qi scratched his head, feigning confusion.

"Are you daft? Aside from you, where are there any other boat trackers on this street? Alright, if you aren't buying anything, leave quickly. Don't delay my work. River Breaking is about to end and people will be coming. Are you going to compensate me for my losses?" Seeing that Li Qi had no intention of buying, the vendor hurriedly waved his hand to shoo him away.

Li Qi immediately stepped back, not disturbing the man's stocking and setup.

He had obtained what he wanted.

Just as he thought, under normal circumstances, the boat trackers would definitely be at the River Breaking site, not wandering around idly.

Since the people from the Strong Force Gang were neither at the River Breaking site nor wandering the streets...

It was evident they hadn't gone out and were huddled together.

Ordinary boat trackers lived hand-to-mouth, working one day to eat next; they basically had no savings. Even if they did, it wasn't much and couldn't support them for many days. Young single dogs like Li Qi were fine—one person fed, the whole family full—and could save a little.

If it was a boat tracker who was already married, the financial pressure was immense.

To gather together under that kind of pressure, ignoring River Breaking and not wandering the streets... the problem was massive.

What could over two hundred boat trackers gathered together in this era possibly be doing? Throwing a party?

It's not like this is Chengdu[^1].

Li Qi decisively quickened his pace.

With so many people gathered, it might be a rally or something similar; he had to check the situation quickly.

He knew the location of the Strong Force Gang's headquarters. It was right next to a tributary of the Li River inside the city.

Tributaries of the Li River spread throughout the city like capillaries, resembling a water town in Jiangnan; they were the water source the entire city relied upon for survival.

He quickly arrived at the riverside. The Li River tributary spreading through the city was still frozen, covered by a layer of ice.

This was exactly what he wanted.

According to the heat island effect, the local temperature in residential areas would be much higher than by the main river.

This meant the ice layer here was more fragile.

He randomly found a tributary, stepped onto it, stomped twice, and looked around. No one.

Very hollow.

Good thing.

He stomped down violently, and the ice surface shattered.

He decisively dropped directly through the breach.

There were three boat tracker gangs in Li Prefecture City.

The Water Horse Gang's cultivation method excelled in endurance, claiming to be as resilient as oxen and horses. They could pull for six hours without stopping, and their skin was thick; tow ropes couldn't abrade their skin, making them more durable.

The Strong Force Gang's cultivation method excelled in increasing strength. A boat that required fifty people from other gangs could be pulled by thirty of them.

As for the Wave-Rowing Gang's cultivation method...

One could tell by the name: the Wave-Rowing Gang excelled in water. They could pull boats while in the water, without needing to stand on the shore.

Li Qi took a deep breath and channeled the Wave-Shattering Force. Like a fish, he moved rapidly beneath the frozen surface.

The frozen ice provided him with almost perfect cover. Although he couldn't breathe, with the support of the Wave-Shattering Force, he could stay underwater for half an hour without needing to breathe.

And he only needed five minutes to swim to the Strong Force Gang's territory.

Soon, he arrived at the waters of the Strong Force Gang. This was a small alley in the city with a tributary passing through it.

The people living in this place were all poor. A group of tailors and the Strong Force Gang—two factions—lived here. Because of this relationship, the Strong Force Gang's clothes were much better than those of the other two gangs.

Those tailors were not to be trifled with either. They could use flying needles as hidden weapons and had a good relationship with the Strong Force Gang. Since there was no conflict of interest and they lived together, they formed an alliance to help each other.

Upon arriving here, Li Qi became much more cautious.

He could see that some holes had been opened in the ice, with fishhooks extending down.

They were all mud-legged paupers living by the water; naturally, they wanted to catch some fish to subsidize their household expenses and have a rare meal of meat.

However, there were only fishhooks, no fishing nets.

That was because fishing with nets was the exclusive right of the city's Fishmonger Heads. Anyone who dared to privately use fishing boats or nets would be making enemies of all the Fishmonger Heads in the city, and those fishermen wielding harpoons were not to be trifled with.

This was the status quo of this world: various groups and classes were clearly stratified.

Carefully dodging the fishhooks, he swam until he reached a spot near the bank with no holes and no hooks.

He listened intently.

After another quarter of an hour, Li Qi realized that those fishhooks had barely moved.

Discovering this, he simply dove deeper, caught a fish himself, held it securely with his water skills, hooked its gills, swam to a fishhook, and hung the fish onto it.

Its lips pierced, the fish thrashed wildly!

The pulling fishing line stretched continuously, eventually even dragging a rod down.

In the end, no one pulled the fish up.

There was no one up there!

When Li Qi had just been listening against the ice, he hadn't heard a sound. He had also noticed the fishhooks weren't moving, which was why he decided to test it.

Now, with this test and no one pulling the rod, it was clear there was absolutely no one above.

He waited a while longer, then grabbed the dragged-down fishing rod, pulled the fish back, removed the hook, and hung it onto another rod.

Multiple uses; catching fish was hard, after all.

This fish was hung three times in a row, its mouth turned into a sieve, before it finally escaped the demonic clutch and fled in terror!

Killing a fish is but a single cut; never had it seen one hung three times!

As for Li Qi, he was finally unable to hold his breath any longer.

The time of half an hour was almost up. His hands and feet were stiff from the freezing water, and his face was blue and purple.

Even with the Wave-Shattering Force protecting his body, he was nearing his limit.

After confirming again and again that no one was above, he found a fishing hole, leaped out from it swiftly, and without a moment's delay, rolled and charged toward the shore.

The original plan was that if someone were guarding the spot, he would break the ice from the other side to create a disturbance and lure the tiger from the mountain.

But since there was no one, he might as well just go up.

His speed was fast, and the ice was slippery, so he slid across in a flash.

Entering the alley, he immediately jumped up, keeping an eye on his surroundings while running toward the Strong Force Gang's headquarters.

These were all residences, but there seemed to be no people. Just as he had estimated earlier, their people were all gathered together, so these outer residences were empty.

He mainly had to watch out for those tailors, so he deliberately avoided the tailors' houses, walking in the narrow gaps as much as possible.

The streets were empty, and he was careful, so he walked the whole way without being discovered, smoothly arriving at the square where the Strong Force Gang usually gathered for discussions.

Although called a square, it was actually just an open space in front of the Strong Force Gang leader's house, about sixty or seventy square meters. Usually, it was used for drying fish and clothes, but when there was business, they gathered here to deliberate.

After all, in this small alley, this was the only place that could hold one or two hundred burly men.

Li Qi approached cautiously, hiding his body behind a wall, pricking up his ears to listen to the sounds in the square.

There were indeed voices in the square; the boat trackers were all gathered there.

Some boat trackers were conversing, and they hadn't lowered their voices.

After all, they were just boat trackers; it was impossible for them to have good discipline. Even university students couldn't manage to stay silent when gathered in a group, so how could one expect boat trackers to do so?

It was precisely because Li Qi knew this that he hid and listened without even looking.

While he was at it, he took off his upper garment and wrapped it around his face, revealing only his eyes.

Some Strong Force Gang trackers who were closer were loudly discussing the day's events.

"Say, is that Art Master's word really credible?"

"You've asked that four times already. The Boss believes him, so what can you do if you don't?"

"You two, really. You saw it with your own eyes, how can you not believe? That was a spell art! It's who knows how much stronger than our body refining cultivation methods. If there's a chance to learn spell arts, what are you complaining about?"

"Today is River Breaking! If we don't go to River Breaking, what if that Art Master is tricking us? Wouldn't we lose the reward for nothing?"

"Quiet down, he's coming out, he's coming out!"

As soon as these words were spoken, Li Qi immediately heard the sound of a crowd standing up, as well as the sound of a door opening.

He had truly arrived at a coincidence this time. An Art Master... The Strong Force Gang was involved with an Art Master? That Art Master promised to teach the Strong Force Gang spells?

How was that possible!

Li Qi knew very well how heavily this world valued things like cultivation methods.

Every cultivation method, even the crudest one, was a precious treasure sufficient to pass down through a family and establish a legacy!

Therefore, after hearing this, even he couldn't help but peek his head out from the alley to look at the open space not far away.

As expected, a crowd of large men stood in the open space, forming a tight encirclement, all of them staring intently at two people in the center.

One burly man Li Qi recognized: the leader of the Strong Force Gang.

The other was a young scholar, wearing cotton clothes that were completely different from the linen worn by the boat trackers.

And this young scholar was actually holding something very familiar to Li Qi.

_That is my fucking game console! Why is this half here!?_

[^1]: In Chinese internet slang, Chengdu is often jokingly referred to as the "Gay Capital" (腐都, Fǔdū). Li Qi is making a dirty joke: he sees 200 men huddled together in secret and thinks, "What are they doing? Having a party?" He then dismisses it by saying, "It's not like we're in Chengdu," implying that if this were Chengdu, a gathering of 200 men would likely be a massive orgy.
