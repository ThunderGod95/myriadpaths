# Chapter 19: Elsewhere

Li Qi looked at the crowd and voiced his thoughts, "Though that thing can't hurt us for now, this is a slow death. Once we are utterly exhausted, we won't even have the strength to run."

"I know a spell art—you've seen it before—that grants me the strength of an ox. Combined with my own power, I have a massive strength of six thousand eight hundred jin. It also makes my Yang qi boil so the mist cannot approach. I will go in and fight while you all bolster my momentum from behind. If I fall into a disadvantage, you step forward, clash your weapons, sing, and drive it away!"

"This way, we can actually damage the demon while I remain in an invincible position. If we can kill or drive off this demon before we collapse, we live."

"Better to take a gamble than to just waste away waiting for death. If you're willing, nod. If not, shake your head," Li Qi said to them.

Having finished, he grabbed his water skin and took a drink to moisten his throat. After singing for two hours, even with the superior physical fitness of people in this world, his throat was parched and felt like it was smoking.

When he said this, everyone looked at each other in hesitation.

Li Qi ignored them, going about his own business—drinking water and eating rice cakes to recover his stamina.

However, he kept his back straight and his head held high, projecting an air of absolute confidence, as if he weren't afraid of the surrounding black mist at all.

Seeing this, Ah Du gritted his teeth and nodded in agreement.

To show his support, he even stopped singing entirely to rest, saying, "I agree with Brother Li. This isn't a long-term solution. we have to take the initiative. Let's all stop and wait for that bastard to come!"

The merchants exchanged looks. Finally, the big man—the one who had first wanted to teach Li Qi a lesson and later warned him—was the first to nod.

Once he nodded, the others reached a consensus.

In a crisis, there was no room for indecision. These merchants naturally understood that.

Thus, the big man prepared himself. Two of his companions quickened their pace, taking over his rhythm of clashing choppers so the overall sound remained unchanged while allowing him to step out.

"I'll go with you! You seem like a real man; I won't hold that business from earlier today against you. After we get through this, I'm buying you a drink!" The burly man walked up to Li Qi and spoke.

At the same time, he held his chopper, looking aggressive and imposing.

"Good," Li Qi nodded in agreement, saying nothing more.

Since their lives were on the line, there was no point dwelling on trifles. It was time to act.

With everything settled, the merchants lowered their choppers almost simultaneously.

At that exact moment, the black mist suddenly converged and surged from one direction, like a giant maw opening to swallow these stubborn travelers.

Having made the plan, Li Qi and the big man did not hesitate. Both charged out of the crowd immediately, meeting the black mist together!

The big man was in the lead; he seemed even more anxious than Li Qi, taking larger strides. This brute raised his chopper and hacked at the mist!

The blade seemed to flicker with a hint of red light and carried a faint scent of blood as it struck the mouth formed by the mist.

There was a thud—as if the chopper hadn't hit mist, but rather a large block of copper.

The big man was sent flying backward. The chopper slipped from his grasp as his webbing tore, spraying blood.

The black mist quickly split off a portion, attempting to catch the blood in mid-air to consume it.

But before the mist could reach it, Li Qi, who had already activated his Ox Strength Art, followed close behind and slammed a precise punch into that fragment of mist.

"Ha!" Li Qi roared, throwing a punch with all his might. With six thousand jin of force combined with his boiling Yang qi, the separated mist was directly shattered!

He didn't know what it was or what the mist intended, but through these few encounters, he had learned a profound lesson: in battle, once the opponent starts a "progress bar," no matter what it is, just interrupt it!

The progress bar had appeared the moment the mist tried to devour the blood.

He timed it perfectly, landing the punch before the bar could finish, ruining the opponent's attempt and letting the blood fall to the ground and soak into the soil.

"This thing craves blood!" one of the merchants shouted.

Li Qi's move seemed to have enraged the black mist. Before Li Qi could recover from his punch, more mist flew toward him, transforming into four or five snapping maws with sharp teeth, like the mouths of wild beasts.

The big man had already fallen, his chopper thrown far away. Li Qi was in better shape, but he couldn't defend against this strike in time either.

However, the preparations behind him immediately took effect!

Ah Du was the first to step forward, singing loudly.

The merchants followed closely, standing in a tight group as their choppers clashed rhythmically, creating a sharp metallic din.

A dozen men stepped forward together, shouting, singing, and clashing weapons. The black mist instantly collapsed; all the bloody maws scattered and were forced to retreat.

Li Qi even thought he heard a faint wail.

"Yes, just like that! We can wear it down to death!" Li Qi scrambled to his feet, ran a few steps to pick up the fallen chopper, and tossed it to the big man who had just stood up.

"Good! It seems my time isn't up tonight!" The big man grew excited, catching the chopper and shooting Li Qi a look of gratitude.

It seemed the method was indeed working. Moreover, he hadn't expected this skinny little guy to possess such strength! It completely exceeded his expectations.

Since the method worked, they only needed to keep executing it.

The battle resumed. The merchants and Ah Du retreated, letting the mist back in.

The big man and Li Qi met it once more, prepared to wear down this demon or frighten it off!

Only then would they find a way to survive.

However, at that very moment...

Not far from the black mist, there was a dilapidated small temple by the roadside.

It was the kind of common mountain village shrine, a rural illicit cult, worshiping things like Great Immortal Huang[^1] or the Five Tong Gods[^2]. These things were not recognized by the government; most were products of mountain spirits and wild monsters playing god to deceive foolish men and women.

There were also some gods who truly had divine powers but whose philosophies clashed with the government, such as martyrs of the previous dynasty or enemy generals. After death, temples were erected and golden statues sculpted for them in their hometowns to receive incense offerings. But after the nation was destroyed and conquered by the enemy, the legitimacy of such sacrifices would not be recognized. They would not be entered into the orthodox registry and were uniformly classified as illicit cults.

But looking at this small temple, just a dilapidated shack, it couldn't be a temple for some Great General. It was surely a broken temple where rural mountain spirits lured in incense.

Only, inside this temple sat a beautiful, delicate woman.

She frowned, looking toward the place emitting the noise in the distance.

_The spell art of a Grand Invocator of Baiyue... Ox Strength Art? Has a Shaman set their sights on me?_

[^1]: While there is a famous and legitimate Taoist deity known as Wong Tai Sin (Huang Chuping) worshiped widely in places like Hong Kong and Zhejiang, in the context of wild monsters and rural folklore—especially in Northern China—this term usually refers to the Yellow Weasel Spirit (Weasel). In Chinese shamanic traditions (specifically the adoration of the Five Great Immortals or animal spirits), the Weasel is respectfully called "Lord Huang" or "Great Immortal Huang" to avoid offending it. They are believed to possess the power to control minds or cause hallucinations. It is implied here that a wild weasel spirit is posing as a god to trick villagers.

[^2]: Also known as the Five-Power Deities or the Spirits of the Five Penetrations. These are a notorious group of deities/demons in Chinese folklore, historically associated with the Jiangnan region. They are complex figures: on one hand, they were worshipped by some for bringing sudden, immense wealth ("borrowing from the Wutong"). On the other hand, they were feared as malevolent demons known for kidnapping or sexually assaulting women and causing madness. Because of their disruptive and lustful nature, their worship was frequently branded as an "illicit cult" (淫祀) and banned by imperial governments throughout history (such as during the Qing dynasty), fitting the description in the novel perfectly.
