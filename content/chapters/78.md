# Chapter 78: Inquiry

On the path of cultivation, there is a saying: "One man's poison is another man's honey."

Was water qi a good thing?

Not necessarily. If an ordinary person possessed an excess of water qi, they would suffer from edema and blood stasis.

But without water qi, one would suffer from internal heat and sores.

Right now, Old Man Li's harmonized layout of the five elements had been thrown into disarray. The intrusion of the mountain root's water qi caused water to flourish and fire to weaken, disrupting his five elements entirely.

So, was this a bad thing?

Of course not. Water qi was merely a type of qi. It possessed no inherent good or evil; it simply came down to whether someone needed it or not.

However, qi was not something you could simply reject at will. Otherwise, it would be impossible for the reckless absorption of foreign qi to cause an imbalance within one's personal cosmos.

Absorbing or expelling different types of qi required specific cultivation methods. This was exactly why the ghost of Old Man Li was agonizing over the mass of water qi in his tomb—he had no means to deal with it.

But Li Qi did!

Not only did he have a method, but he also desperately needed this very thing! The cultivation of the Carp Stream Intent required water qi to convert into internal qi!

Surrounded by Yin qi, this mountain root water qi had been nurtured within the tomb for a century. Its quality might even rival the pure water qi bestowed by the god of the Li River!

He had struck it rich!

He had been planning to travel far and wide in search of water qi, yet here it was, delivering itself right to his doorstep.

It truly was like someone offering a pillow just as he grew sleepy.

"An Invocator can help me purge the water qi?" the ghost asked, a pleasant surprise coloring his voice.

"I can, but as for the Wang family's affairs..." Li Qi mused, letting his voice trail off.

"If the Invocator can help me empty this water qi and reconstruct my five elements, I am willing to let bygones be bygones regarding the Wang family!" the ghost declared immediately.

Then, as if feeling that wasn't enough, he quickly added, "I am also willing to use my Ghostly God qi to protect the Invocator!"

Li Qi nodded at those words. "You see, is there anything we cannot discuss and resolve? Since we have an agreement, let it be so. Return for now. I will have the Wang family bring me over to clear the water qi for you."

"I respectfully see the Invocator off," the ghost said with deep reverence.

Li Qi straightened his back and withdrew his consciousness from the altar space.

"Master! Master, what happened!? Have you reached an agreement!?" Seeing Li Qi emerge, Patriarch Wang immediately threw himself forward.

Li Qi nimbly sidestepped him. "It is settled. Take me to the tomb so I can pinpoint the location."

Patriarch Wang did not dare waste another breath and immediately led the way.

After Li Qi confirmed the location, he instructed Patriarch Wang to return and prepare millet and the five preparations of bright water to conduct another ritual.

Following that, Li Qi hurried back to find Shen Shuibi and Old Ma.

Along the way, Li Qi felt an inexplicable thrill.

It wasn't for any superficial reason, but rather because, for the first time, he had truly accomplished what an Invocator was meant to do—something only a cultivator could achieve.

It felt just like a fresh university graduate landing their first job and executing a project flawlessly. It was a profound, heartfelt sense of joy and accomplishment!

He had fully utilized his knowledge, negotiated with a Ghostly God, mediated the conflict between human and ghost, and even secured compensation from both sides in the process.

Although he had relied on Young Master Zhu's willow branch to intimidate the opposing party, equipment was undoubtedly an aspect of one's true strength.

A sudden epiphany washed over him.

_This_ was what it meant to be a cultivator.

Cultivation was not solely about fighting and killing. A cultivator would naturally fulfill their own responsibilities according to the power they wielded.

Cultivation was not merely the pursuit of personal strength. It was more akin to mastering a broader array of skills and weapons, enabling one to better implement their own thoughts and ideals.

For an Invocator, the core philosophy of this Dao Lineage was to harmonize humans, gods, and ghosts, bringing the three into peaceful alignment.

Rituals were not the entirety of an Invocator's existence; they were simply the methods and tools used to achieve this philosophy.

Rituals could help an Invocator elevate their power, allowing them to better fulfill this ideal and execute this philosophy. Therefore, Invocators learned rituals and pursued greater strength.

If they lacked the guidance of the classic within the [Book of Invocation] and only mastered the methods of sacrifice, then rituals would cease to be tools for harmonizing humans, ghosts, and gods, and instead become mere weapons in someone's hands.

It was like how a pencil could be used to kill three men in a bar, but its true purpose was to write, to record, and to allow words and ideas to spread.

If one strayed from the philosophy of an Invocator... and only mastered their cultivation and combat techniques, what would become of them in the end?

Perhaps they would end up just like Old Man Li—suffering an imbalance in their personal cosmos and dying a premature death.

Through this series of events, Li Qi vaguely felt as though he had grasped something fundamental.

'Dao' referred to both the laws of nature and the philosophy of the Daoist seeker.

A Daoist Tradition was an organization formed by a group of like-minded individuals gathering together in an attempt to manifest their Dao in the world.

Then, did cultivating and pursuing the Dao mean implementing one's own ideas to make them align with the rules of nature?

Or... if the rules of nature did not align, did it mean—altering nature itself?

Was it changing oneself to fit nature, or forcing nature to change so that one's own rules could be enforced?

Li Qi did not know the answer.

But he roughly understood why the human body was referred to as a 'personal cosmos.'

_My body is also a universe, and it also possesses a Dao. This Dao is my philosophy, my Dao._

_The vast external universe also possesses a Dao, and this Dao represents the rules of nature._

_So... this must be the reason why various sects and organizations name themselves after a certain 'Dao', right?_ Li Qi thought silently to himself.

He wasn't sure if his reasoning was correct, but it felt incredibly logical.

Regardless, the grave-digging incident was finally resolved.

However, he still needed to return and consult his living database, Shen Shuibi, to obtain precise information before he could determine his next steps.

Moreover, Li Qi felt somewhat conflicted about Old Madam Wang's situation.

Although he had technically saved the Wang family, was it truly appropriate for her to trade her life to save Old Ma for him?

Li Qi hesitated, unable to make a firm decision.

He had no fondness for Old Madam Wang. After all, her attitude toward him from the very beginning had been extremely utilitarian, and even later on, she was still calculating how to use him.

But looking at the situation as a whole, she hadn't really done anything inherently evil. She was utilitarian, yes, but trading her own life was simply the desperate act of a mother wanting her son to survive.

Pity the hearts of parents everywhere.

He would figure it out when the time came. Old Ma's situation... was indeed tricky to handle. Truly forcing the other party to commit suicide felt somewhat...

Lost in these thoughts, Li Qi walked all the way into the forest.

Since they were already outside the city, returning to the woods was simple. He whistled sharply, and Shen Shuibi and Old Ma quickly appeared.

"Li Qi, you're back? Is the matter settled? Are we setting off to find Her Ladyship now?" Shen Shuibi asked, barely able to contain her eagerness.

"Almost done," Li Qi replied. "Let's sit down first. Old Ma, come over here too. I have something to tell you both."

Li Qi pulled Old Ma and Shen Shuibi to a halt.

"Ah? What's wrong?" Shen Shuibi looked bewildered.

Old Ma also seemed clueless as to what was happening.

Li Qi spoke up, "Old Ma, regarding your previous master..."

Before he could even finish his sentence, Old Ma's hooves began to shift uneasily.
