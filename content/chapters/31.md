# Chapter 31: Inheritance

Seemingly sensing Li Qi's confusion, Young Master Zhu explained while transmitting the inheritance,

"The thing known as divine will inheritance was initially created to directly instill understanding into disciples and sect members. It carried severe subjective intent and could even directly twist the disciples' paths, turning them into copies of oneself and cutting off their future roads."

"Later, the Confucian Sages proposed that the the true meaning of the Dao should be a universal truth, applicable in all places and enduring through all ages. Why, then, should one impose one's own understanding upon a disciple? Thus, the technique was improved to only transmit the original scripture, without adding excessive subjective interpretation."

"Therefore, the inheritance will not rapidly improve your comprehension, nor will it allow you to recite it from memory. However, it can save you the distress of carrying a stack of books everywhere every day. How is it? Is it not very convenient? The book is stored directly into your mind, ready to be consulted at any time," Young Master Zhu said with a smile.

Li Qi, however, wore a subtle expression, as if he did not know what to say...

What should he say?

There seemed to be nothing good to say. The people of this world... were truly not stupid at all. There were absolutely no loopholes for him to reform. Trying to rely on his own knowledge to propose modification plans was extraordinarily difficult...

However, this was actually more normal. No matter what, he might have some novel whims or different experiences, but to want to surpass the wisdom of this world was still too arrogant.

The inheritance involved almost no pain; there was just an additional cultivation method for Invocators in his brain. The name was very simple, a single word: [Invocation].

But when he carefully immersed himself in it, he suddenly felt... grandeur.

It was truly grand. It seemed that what was in his brain was not simply a cultivation method! It was a set of encyclopedias!

The recorded things were complicated to an unbelievable degree. Large things like the Nine Provinces of the world[^1], astronomy and calendarical phenomena; small things like irrigation ditches and roads, vegetation, insects, and fish—all were within it.

There were also rites and music, military affairs and punishments, agriculture, commerce, medicine, and divination. All of this was imprinted in his brain!

The cultivation part actually occupied only a small portion.

The profession of 'Invocator' itself referred to the person who presided over the rites during a sacrifice.

This book, [Invocation], was less a cultivation method and more of a database, established for the knowledge an Invocator needed to understand and know!

Various sacrificial rites, various utensils useful for sacrifices, animals, plants, rituals, and even the forms of mountains, rivers, and earth veins, methods for distinguishing various qi of Heaven and Earth—anyway, as long as it was related to sacrifices, everything should be in here!

Countless bits of knowledge were not instilled into his brain but stored there. He needed to read and memorize them himself to truly remember them. It was just that now, he only needed to move his mind, like searching through a database. Although there would be some delay, the data could indeed appear within a period of time.

For example, right now, Li Qi already clearly knew the sacrificial significance of "Beginning of Spring."

"On the day of the Beginning of Spring, the officials go to welcome Gou Mang and the Clay Ox. Gou Mang is known as The Spring-Breaking Boy. If he wears a hat, the spring will be warm; otherwise, the spring will be cold. If the clay ox is red, there will be drought; if black, there will be flood. People compete to sprinkle it with red beans and five-colored rice to eliminate the year's diseases and rashes. Use the mud from the clay ox to plaster the stove, to fatten the six livestock."[^2]

There were also methods of sacrifice, divided into using blood to sacrifice to the State, the Five Sacrifices, and the Five Sacred Mountains; using burying and sinking to sacrifice to mountain forests and river marshes; and using dismemberment to sacrifice to the four directions and hundred things[^3]. Use the Rites of Misfortune to mourn the worries of the state; use the Rites of Mourning to mourn death; use the Rites of Famine to mourn plague and pestilence; use the Rites of Condolence to mourn disasters; use the Rites of Assembly to mourn defeat; use the Rites of Compassion to mourn invasion and chaos.

Furthermore, if one needs to consecrate the army, one must perform the ritual at the mountains and rivers, and offer sacrificial animals at the state altars[^4].

Additionally, there were various distinct sacrificial methods, broadly classified as rites of ordinance, propagation, inclusion, cycle, rousing, completion, severance, binding, and offering, to name a few.

One could also distinguish various stars of bane, such as the Plunder Star, Calamity Star, Great Bane Star, and so on and so forth.[^5]

It also taught the arts of astrology and sky-gazing, such as divining fortune by observing the five colors of the clouds around the sun[^6], or monitoring the movements of worldly qi[^7] by studying the winds of the twelve months[^8], thereby revealing the omens—be they demonic calamities or auspicious signs—that heaven and earth wished to display.

In short, countless amounts of knowledge—even including the Sacrifice from Afar[^9], the Sacrifice of Expansion[^10], the Conferring of Titles[^11], and so on—were all recorded one by one.

Everything an Invocator was expected to do was clearly annotated.

However, much of it Li Qi simply could not comprehend. The words were there, but their meaning was lost on him, like an elementary school student trying to read advanced calculus; he could stare at it all day and remain utterly baffled.

Compared to this bewilderingly vast collection of knowledge, the actual method of cultivation was described in a remarkably short section.

It was very simple. The cultivation method of an Invocator was divided into three branches: Heavenly God, Earthly Divinity, and Human Ghost. The one in Li Qi's hand was the Earthly Divinity branch.

One need only perform timely sacrifices to the mountains and rivers, maintain reverence for the spirits of nature, and follow the prescribed rituals. By doing so, one could extract the power of the Earthly Divinities and the myriad things of the world, gathering it within oneself and storing it deep inside the body.

There was no mention of a dantian, no need for energy convergence points, and not even a process of compressing energy from a gaseous to a liquid state. Many of the cultivation concepts he had encountered before were rendered useless.

According to the book, this was because the human body was a microcosm of heaven and earth, capable of containing a vast number of things on its own. Symbolic concepts like "qi" could hardly begin to fill this personal cosmos.

Cultivating like this, slowly accumulating, he could then gradually contact stronger and more numerous Earthly Divinities, obtain even more powerful strength, and use even more formidable spell arts.

Everything was so leisurely and natural, not intense, and there were no bottlenecks to speak of.

It was a very peaceful cultivation method, so peaceful that Li Qi dared not believe there was actually a cultivation method where the road was open and smooth without needing to fight, kill, and snatch resources...

The novels he read before were read in vain.

This was the path of the Shaman Dao.

However, although peaceful, generally speaking, there were still distinctions in rank.

According to this book, there were countless methods in the world, and the level of each was different. Inferior ones like the Wave-Shattering Force had an upper limit of only one layer; finishing it would allow one to reach the standard of an adult in this world. High-grade ones like this book [Invocation], well, the upper limit was unknown.

Various methods had their own realms and their own tiers. Even between the various traditions, there were different divisions. The Confucian Dao had its own ranks, the Shaman Dao had its own classifications, and the Daoist Sects also had terms like Primordial Spirit and Golden Core. The ranks among various different cultivation methods were very chaotic and difficult to distinguish.

So the Sages set down rules. Regardless of the tradition, all were unified by one standard, and that was Ninth Rank to First Rank.

Li Qi was flipping through the books in his brain here, but Young Master Zhu could not wait. He said again, "What should be said, what should be learned, and what should be comprehended are all in the divine will inheritance. I won't say more about memorization. I will introduce another person to you. Oh... a demon." After speaking, he gently pulled at the space behind him.

[^1]: In Chinese culture, the **Nine Provinces** is a classical term used to represent the entire known word or China itself.

    The concept dates back to the legend of **Yu the Great (Da Yu)**, a mythical ruler who tamed the Great Flood. After controlling the waters, he divided the land into nine distinct regions (Provinces/Zhōu) to make them governable and collect tribute.
    
    Over time, "Nine Provinces" stopped referring to specific administrative borders and became a poetic synonym for "The Land," "The Empire," or "The Civilized World."
    
    When the text says the book contains knowledge of the "Nine Provinces of the world," it means the book contains complete geographical knowledge of the entire world. It covers the macro-geography (the Nine Provinces) down to the micro-biology (insects and fish).
[^2]: A ceremony held on the first day of spring. Officials displayed clay effigies of the Spring God (Goumang) and the Earth Ox. The figures acted as a visual almanac: their clothing and colors foretold the year's weather (e.g., a hat predicted warmth; a red ox predicted drought). The ritual ended with scattering beans to ward off disease and plastering kitchen stoves with mud from the ox to bless the household's livestock.
[^3]: The author is quoting directly from the Rites of Zhou (Zhouli), a real historical text from ancient China that detailed the bureaucracy and religious ceremonies of the Zhou Dynasty.

    **1. Blood Sacrifice to the State (血祭 - Xuèjì to Shèjì)**

    Sheji (社稷) literally refers to the "God of the Earth" (She) and the "God of the Five Grains" (Ji).
    
    In Chinese history, the Altar of Earth and Grain was the symbol of political legitimacy. If the altar was destroyed, the kingdom had fallen. Therefore, offering "blood" to the Sheji is the highest form of state worship.
    
    **2. The Five Sacrifices (五祀 - Wǔsì)**

    These are the Household Gods.
    
    While the Emperor worships Heaven and Earth, regular people (and officials) worship the gods of the home.
    
    This highlights that [Invocation] covers everything from the highest state affairs down to the kitchen stove.
    
    **3. The Five Sacred Mountains (五岳 - Wǔyuè)**

    The specific "Pillars of Heaven" in Chinese geography.
    
    * East: Mount Tai (Taishan)
    * West: Mount Hua (Huashan)
    * South: Mount Heng (Hengshan - Hunan)
    * North: Mount Heng (Hengshan - Shanxi)
    * Center: Mount Song (Songshan)

    These mountains are often seen as the "anchors" of the world's spiritual energy veins. Sacrificing to them stabilizes the land itself.
    
    **4. Burying and Sinking (貍沈 - Lí Shěn)**

    * **Burying (Lí/Mái):** Used for Mountain/Forest spirits. Since these gods live in the earth, you dig a hole and bury the jade or animal offering so it physically reaches their domain (Yin).
    * **Sinking (Shěn):** Used for River/Marsh spirits. The offerings are directly thrown into the water so it sinks to the riverbed where the god resides.

    **5. Dismemberment (疈辜 - Pì Gū)**
    
    Pi (疈) means to split open the chest; Gu (辜) implies tearing apart.
    
    "The Four Directions" and "Hundred Things" refer to Nature spirits, monsters, vague phenomena.
    
    **Why Dismember?** Ancient ritual logic held that spirits of the air/wind/directions were formless and scattered.
    
    * By splitting the chest of the sacrifice, the hot blood and internal Qi disperse rapidly into the air.
    * Unlike burying (for earth) or sinking (for water), "dismemberment/splitting" releases the offering into the wind to reach the spirits of the Four Directions.

[^4]: Compound term for the territory of the state, and the ancestoral temples.
[^5]: In _Feng Shui_ and _Bazi_, Shen Sha (神煞) refers to "Gods and Banes" (or "Spirits and Killings").

    * **Gods:** Beneficial stars/energies that bring good luck.
    * **(Banes)**: Malicious stars/energies that bring bad luck, accidents, or death.

    Plunder Star, Calamity Star, Great Bane, are specific types of bad luck or negative stars that an Invocator can detect in a person's fate or a location's Feng Shui.
[^6]: In ancient Chinese divination, clouds around the sun were not just vapor; they were manifestations of the Five Elements (Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water).

    By observing which color dominated the halo around the sun, an Invocator could predict what kind of event was about to happen (e.g., "A red cloud means an army is approaching").
[^7]: The world breathes. It has a natural rhythm of rising (Yang) and falling (Yin) energy throughout the year.

    If the "Worldly Qi" is stagnant, crops fail. If it is chaotic, monsters appear. An Invocator monitors this "pulse" to see if the world is healthy or sick. It is like taking the blood pressure of the planet.
[^8]: This refers to the "Eight Winds" (Bafeng) or the specific winds associated with the Twelve Earthly Branches (the zodiac months).

    Ancient military strategists believed that the direction and quality of the wind in each specific month predicted the future.
    
    _Example:_ If a strong southern wind blows during the winter solstice (a time of North/Water), it clashes with the season, indicating "rebellion" or "disorder."
[^9]: In the Rites of Zhou, this is a specific category of royal sacrifice offered to famous mountains and great rivers. It is called "Sacrifice from Afar" because the Emperor would stand in the capital and sacrifice towards the mountain in the distance, rather than traveling there.
[^10]: Referring to sacrifices meant to spread blessing or cleanse an area.
[^11]: In Chinese folk religion, the State (or powerful Invocators) had the authority to "promote" a spirit. A local snake spirit could be officially given the title "Duke of the River." This legitimized the god.
