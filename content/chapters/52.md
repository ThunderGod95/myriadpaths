# Chapter 52: Critical Danger

The Earthly Divinity lineage among the Invocators excelled at borrowing the momentum of mountain and water gods. If sheltered by the corresponding deity, they could trigger localized earthquakes or alter river courses at merely Rank Eight.

The advantage such power brought to a battlefield was self-evident.

Yet, it was not insurmountable.

Cultivators of the Military lineage also adeptly utilized terrain, and more importantly, they could leverage human unity.

Heavenly Gods? Earthly Divinities?

How could they possibly rival human unity!

The Military lineage, after all, was a major branch of the Human Dao.

The Human Dao held the least faith in heaven and earth.

Humanity would surely conquer the heavens!

"Get into formation! Raise arms!" the officer shouted.

The other men instantly raised their weapons, and a bizarre connection established itself around them.

The blades of all the soldiers ignited with a crimson glow.

Fire birthed at the tips; this was martial qi.

Blood qi dwelled within the fire; this was baleful qi!

Martial qi and baleful qi intertwined, manifesting a phenomenon above their heads.

Their auras linked together like melon vines, resembling a giant wielding a blade and shield—a vast expanse of crimson, just like blood.

Observing from beneath the water, Li Qi immediately realized this was a military formation similar to the one Big Strong Shan had used back then!

However, compared to Big Strong Shan's, this military formation was overwhelmingly stronger.

Li Qi could see the fierce malice within it! Red as battle flags with soldiers marching beneath, its imposing momentum was absolutely not something he could contend with!

There were merely nine men, yet their oppressive might was this terrifying.

Fortunately, he was staying in the water, and everything was still going according to plan.

Never before had he felt so thankful that he had actively practiced the Wave-Shattering Force; it granted him excellent swimming skills and allowed him to hold his breath for over thirty minutes.

Seeing the formation ready, the officer nodded. "Use the martial qi to suppress the mountain's roots and lock down the water veins. Absolutely do not let him borrow the power of the mountains and rivers! Invocators do not understand martial combat and are frail in close quarters. I will go down and deal with him!"

With those words, he stripped off his armor, dove directly into the water, clamped his teeth around his saber's hilt, and swam vigorously toward Li Qi.

Seeing this, joy bloomed in Li Qi's heart.

_He actually came down!_

But he did not dare surface; at this moment, crossbows were locked onto his position from above, and going up would turn him into a hedgehog.

Thus, he remained at the bottom of the deep pool, waiting for the officer to dive deeper.

Down in the pool, the officer gripped the blade in his mouth, its glowing tip brightly illuminating the dark underwater depths.

Very quickly, he spotted Li Qi.

Taking the saber in one hand, he closed in.

Underwater, Li Qi did not fear him in the slightest, sliding forward along the current.

Indeed, this officer was swimming with sheer effort, thrashing water in all directions; his great strength made his speed quite fast.

But Li Qi was different.

Li Qi made almost no commotion while swimming. While the officer swam, Li Qi simply glided. Like a fish in the water, he produced no splashes and used no brute force, yet he was even faster!

It was glaringly obvious that this officer's aquatic skills were far inferior to his own.

He, after all, was someone who could tie a towline around his body and pull a riverboat while swimming!

Li Qi drew closer.

Seeing him approach, the officer raised his blade and thrust!

The water's resistance was heavy, making slashing slow, but stabbing was not sluggish at all.

However, underwater, any movement—even the slightest twitch—inevitably stirred the currents.

By skillfully manipulating these currents, one could drift with the waves and naturally evade an opponent's attacks!

Sensing the turbulent flow generated by the opponent's forceful thrust, Li Qi dodged sideways. The current naturally caught his body, swaying him to the side just enough to perfectly evade the blade.

Pulling boats through the water was not safe; logs, stones, and various debris frequently drifted down from upstream.

With the rushing rapids, getting hit by such objects would guarantee a busted head and flowing blood.

Therefore, any tracker daring to haul ships from the water absolutely had to master the technique of shifting their body according to the currents; those who could not sense the flow and react had their skulls smashed open long ago.

This immense advantage Li Qi held underwater was precisely why he had lured these men down to deal with them.

Slipping past the thrust, Li Qi directly grabbed the officer's wrist!

With the Wave-Shattering Force coursing through him, the water could not hinder his exertion of power. His tremendous strength of six thousand eight hundred catties erupted in an instant, aiming to snap the fragile wrist clean off!

But to Li Qi's utter shock, the officer suddenly smirked and outright released his grip on the saber. Then, as he clenched both fists to protect his wrists, that very blade inexplicably moved on its own!

The edge hummed softly, and urged on by martial qi and baleful qi, the saber actually reversed its point underwater on its own and stabbed viciously toward Li Qi.

Meanwhile, the officer immediately flipped his grip to seize Li Qi's wrist, preventing his escape and intending to lock him dead in the blade's path.

Just moments ago, Li Qi had dragged a soldier down, holding onto the man so he couldn't flee, resulting in him being crushed to death by falling rocks. Now, not even a minute later, he was suffering the exact same tactic!

With the blade about to strike, anxiety flared in Li Qi's heart. Disregarding his endurance, he forcefully tried to rip himself free.

However, the officer maintained a death grip, resolutely refusing to let go.

Left with no choice, Li Qi ignored his energy reserves. As he continued struggling, two streams of white breath suddenly surged from his nose, turning into a string of bubbles underwater that gathered the current and blasted right into the officer's face!

This was the effect brought about by the Ox Strength Art!

Li Qi knew he didn't have many cards to play, so he had brainstormed numerous methods in advance, considering every single ounce of power he could possibly utilize.

This was one of them.

Fortunately, the physical advantage granted by the Ox Strength Art was ultimately overwhelming. Blasted in the face by countless bubbles, the officer—already inept at aquatic combat—panicked, causing his grip to falter just enough for Li Qi to break free.

Once free, Li Qi instantly spent his last ounce of strength to flip backward, narrowly evading the blade.

But it truly was a near miss; his skin was still sliced open, leaking a bit of blood.

The wound was not large, roughly comparable to nicking a finger while chopping vegetables.

Yet from this tiny cut alone, Li Qi felt his entire body stiffen.

The wound went numb, and worse, the numbness was steadily spreading!

Martial qi and baleful qi had invaded his body, severing the natural circulation of his nutritive qi and defensive qi!

With his two vital qis obstructed, Li Qi only felt that something was suddenly very wrong with his body.

He did not know why, only that he had fallen victim to an attack.

But if it were Shen Shuibi, she would have surely blurted out: "When nutritive qi fails to comply, resisting the flesh's grain, it breeds carbuncles and swellings; when defensive qi flows in reverse, the pure and turbid clash, causing chaos in the chest known as grave suppression; when qi is disordered in the lungs, one gasps for breath; when it is disordered in the limbs, it causes fourfold coldness."

This meant that the disorder of nutritive qi would collapse bodily functions and produce swellings, while the reversed flow of defensive qi, clashing pure and turbid energies, would make breathing difficult, render the limbs cold and numb, and strip them of their proper functions.

Li Qi now truly felt Old Ma's agony.

Old Ma had been slashed on the rump, and the baleful qi on that blade absolutely had to have come from something like this!

Old Ma's profound weakness was undoubtedly the result of being constantly plagued and entangled by this very same baleful qi!

Off to the side, seeing Li Qi suddenly seize up like a dead fish, his entire body going rigid and motionless, the officer knew his martial qi had taken effect.

A smile surfaced on his face; he had supreme confidence in his martial qi.

However, he remained quite cautious. Gripping the saber in one hand, he slowly swam over again, preparing to ruthlessly land two more strikes on the paralyzed Li Qi.

Only the dead were trustworthy.

The living could always thrash around a couple more times.
