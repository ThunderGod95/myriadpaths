# Chapter 5: Sacrificial Offering

Does the ritual actually work?

There had to be some effect. Otherwise, the words "Ritual Enhancement" wouldn't have appeared on the progress bar.

If he stayed, could he really share in the effects of the ritual?

He didn't know. Li Qi didn't understand any of this; he was simply taking a gamble.

To live a muddled life, working as a boat tracker, selling his manual labor just to survive.

He didn't want that.

Meanwhile, on the other side.

Atop the River Viewing Tower overlooking the Li River.

To monitor the water levels at all times and command a view of the city, a River Viewing Tower had been built by the riverside.

The tower stood hundreds of metres high, towering into the sky. Even modern skyscrapers rarely reached such heights.

The lower levels were filled with taverns and brothels, but beyond the height of hundred metres, idlers were forbidden from entering. As for the top floor, it was managed by the River Officials, who were responsible for river management, inspecting passing vessels, and handling the dredging of embankments.

The prosperity of Li Prefecture relied entirely on the Li River.

The safety of the Li River concerned the livelihood of the entire prefecture. Its importance was self-evident, so ordinarily, no outsiders would appear on the upper levels of the River Viewing Tower aside from the officials on duty.

But today, the River Viewing Tower was lined with layers of altars, attended by nine masked _Wūxí_—male shamans—dressed in strange attire.

These shamans were clad in lotus leaves and water weeds, wearing lotus crowns on their heads. Their faces were painted with seven distinct colors as they twisted their bodies, chanting incantations under their breath.

In the center of the shamans and altars stood a man with disheveled hair, holding a wooden oar and wearing a simple, loose robe.

Surrounded by the numerous altars, he chanted:

<div class="special-announcement">

Heaven and Earth are set apart, each birthing its own resources. The craftsmanship of Tang, the rhinoceros horns of the East, the gold of the West, the ivory of the South, the minerals of the North—staying in their place serves no good. They must be moved elsewhere; this is the profit of circulation!

Alas! The God of the Li River, who channels the rare treasures of the four quarters to endow us! Shaping boats to navigate the waters, commanding a host of ninety million, traversing ten thousand li. His merit is immeasurable, looked up to by the people!

</div>

He shouted the sacrificial prayer while wielding the boat oar in a dance.

To his side, the shamans raised their drumsticks and struck the Tuó drums with force.

To his side, the shamans raised their drumsticks and vigorously struck the Tuó drums, which were crafted from crocodile skin.

The crocodile was known in ancient times as the Tuó. Its skin could be fashioned into drums, and the beating of these drums was said to please the Water God.

Following this commotion, then... one could see a strange energy faintly rising from the entire city of Li Prefecture.

Accompanying this energy, gurgling streams of water suddenly surged from within the altars.

These streams rushed toward the center, toward the man holding the oar.

The man continued to shout:

<div class="special-announcement">

At the cusp of Spring, the Heavenly Season is born! Harmonizing cold and heat, following nature's will. Opening the spirit and pleasing the body, scrubbing away the heart's grime. Clear, bright, and pure; clean as the formless! Precious sands reflecting clearly, illuminating the deepest depths! Pouring into one another, driving away my calamities!

</div>

He was submerged by the flowing water.

The surrounding shamans stopped, drenched in sweat, and collapsed onto the ground to rest.

Their dance didn't look particularly strenuous, yet from their current state, it looked as if they hadn't rested for ten days straight. Their muscles twitched uncontrollably, sweat poured off them like springs, and they lay paralyzed on the floor.

At this moment, a young scholar walked out.

If Li Qi were here, he would absolutely recognize this person as the young scholar who had been with the Strong Force Gang!

"The great affairs of the state lie in Sacrifice and War. The Lord Governor conducts the ceremony with such devotion every year; the King would surely be pleased to hear of it," the young scholar said as he looked at the man wrapped in the water current.

"Young Master Zhu, why do you say such things? Sacrifices are the foundation of the Shaman Dao. The Great Deer Kingdom was founded on the Shaman Dao and respects the laws of ghosts and spirits. How could we not be diligent regarding sacrifices?" The Governor floated in the water, yet he was able to speak normally.

Upon closer inspection, his chest was rising and falling; he was clearly breathing.

Breathing, even while underwater.

"Founded on the Shaman Dao? Yet there are no invocators established, no grand diviners. The palace has no halo observers, no dream diviners, no shamans of the stalks. Instead, prefectures and counties are established, governors and magistrates appointed. You revere a King and set up a bureaucracy. Is this Shaman Dao, or is this Human Dao?" The young man, addressed as Young Master Zhu, said with a smile.

Hearing this, the Governor couldn't smile. His expression instantly became subtle.

"Young Master Zhu, your words are too heavy. The Great Deer Kingdom is naturally based on the Shaman Dao. It is simply that the methods of the Human Dao are adept at gathering the power of all living beings. If one wishes for the nation to expand and grow strong, one must merely borrow the skin of the Human Dao," the Governor immediately defended.

"That would be for the best," Young Master Zhu nodded, looking as if he wanted to say more.

But the Governor didn't want him to speak further, so he quickly interjected, "Young Master Zhu, I heard you've been very close with the common heads and white-clothed peasants recently, frequently moving among the poor. Why is that?"

"During a grand rite a few years ago, I divined a result. An item of the Outer Dao would appear in Li Prefecture City, so I simply asked them to look for it," Young Master Zhu waved his hand, not saying much about this minor matter.

"Although objects of the Outer Dao are somewhat strange, they are mostly scrap with little use. For you to use a Grand Rite to search for this, sir, isn't that a bit... extravagant?" the Governor reminded him.

"It's nothing. The rite was initiated to divine fortune and misfortune, not specifically for the search. It was merely an accidental finding," Young Master Zhu replied seemingly offhandedly.

Then, without waiting for the Governor to speak again, his expression suddenly turned puzzled. "Governor, looking at your ceremony... why does it seem the power has weakened slightly?"

"We are already at the tail end of the ceremony; weakening is a common occurrence. There are also fluctuations normally," the Governor didn't seem to care much. He stopped speaking and immersed himself in the water flow, beginning to absorb the power within.

It had indeed weakened, but probably by less than one ten-thousandth—well within the range of normal fluctuation.

However, Young Master Zhu glanced thoughtfully toward the bottom of the tower.

And downstairs, in a corner.

Li Qi was holding a strange posture, chanting a sacrificial text.

Where did the text come from? Naturally, it was the one the Governor had recited!

It was that very passage: In the Azure Palace, there is the God of Li River, commanding forty-two departments, accompanied by ninety million beings, in charge of the myriad spirits and matters of the ten thousand _li_ of Li River. You trackers are one of its departments, pulling boats and sailing ships, resolving heavenly disasters above, aiding the obscure depths below. Today at the Grand Ceremony of River Breaking, you used _Qi_ to dissolve the calamitous waters, eliminating transgressions and destroying sins. You shall be rewarded!

For some reason, this world used a script similar to Chinese characters. He had some level of literacy, so he could understand it.

So, he made slight modifications. He changed "You boat trackers are one of these departments, pulling boats..." to "We boat trackers are one of these departments, pulling boats with all our hearts..."

And then he changed the ending to: "Today at the Grand Ceremony of River Breaking, we used _Qi_ to dissolve the calamitous waters, eliminating transgressions and destroying sins. We request a reward!"

Was it useful?

Of course it was useful!

Because the progress bar moved!

He had tried many times before, modifying it word by word, including his body movements. He changed them many times. Originally, he had just stood there waiting, but he found that was completely useless.

Even when the River Breaking Ceremony progress bar reached 99.6%, there was no indication he would get a share.

Then, Li Qi immediately started trying other things.

He changed his posture, modified the prayer, and tried many times, all without effect.

Because he had already realized one of the functions of the progress bar: to determine if something was effective!

If it was useful, the progress bar would definitely appear to describe the progress!

He tried for a full three quarters of an hour. Finally, he discovered that when he prostrated himself fully on the ground, facing the Li River, and chanted the prayer, the progress update: "Ritual Enhancement, 1%," finally popped up!

Just as he finally figured out the method, the progress bar for the River Breaking Ceremony had already reached 99.8%.
