# Chapter 1: River Breaking

Great Deer Kingdom, Li Prefecture City.

A great river named the Li River cut through the interior of the prefecture city.

Li Prefecture took its name from the Li River. This great river not only traversed Li Prefecture City but also split into two courses downstream; one flowed north, and the other flowed south. The northern branch entered the Song Kingdom, while the southern branch entered the sea. It could be said to extend in all directions, serving as a critically important waterway for the Great Deer Kingdom. Aside from winter, it was incredibly busy during all other seasons, with hundreds of large and small vessels passing through daily.

Thus, since ancient times, a poem had stated:

<div class="special-announcement">

The Li River bears the profit of the boat and oar,

Flowing south to the vast sea and north to Song shores.

Pushing waves and folding tides to transport wealth,

A single river achieves the merit of enriching the state.

</div>

Although it was the juncture of winter and spring, and the great river had only just thawed, meaning the biting cold winds still blew, the docks were sweltering with heat. Heads bobbed in the crowd as laborers and trackers gathered their body heat. The stench of sweat and the steam of exertion rushed outward together, creating an exceptionally intense atmosphere.

Today was the Beginning of Spring. The Li River was unbinding itself from winter's freeze, but even if it hadn't fully thawed, civilian laborers would be called upon to smash the ice and force a passage for the boats. This entire process was called 'River Breaking.'

Every year during River Breaking, those who relied on the Li River's water transport for their livelihood would gather here. Laborers would chisel the ice to weaken the layers, and then trackers would pull a heavy ship to crush the ice, thoroughly clearing the river channel.

Trackers hauled the boat, laborers smashed the ice; the wind blew against blood and sweat, the sun scorched their skin, and the work chants never ceased.

"Ropes on the shoulder, nine zhang three! Heave-ho!"

The trackers roared their chant, exerting force in unison to pull the massive ship. The thick hull's sails caught the wind, while sailors on deck joined in the chorus. Borrowing the power of the wind and blending it with human strength, they crushed the ice layer into powder.

"A live of toil, tethered to the shoulder! Heave-ho!"

This was no ordinary vessel. It was a specialized great ship brought out only for the annual River Breaking. With a cast-iron bottom and a hull made of century-old timber, no ice layer could withstand a single blow from it.

"Feet stomping stones, hands clawing sand! Heave-ho!"

As the ice layer was crushed open, fractures appeared everywhere. Massive chunks of ice somersaulted in the water, creating miniature icebergs.

"Don't say boats can't sail against the flow! Heave-ho!"

A great river like the Li River was a full five li wide. River Breaking was a massive undertaking that would take a full day of work, and even the Governor of Li Prefecture would come to supervise it personally.

The iron-bottomed great ship charged into the ice layer with astonishing power. The terrifyingly loud cracking sounds of the ice being knocked aside were like a battering ram striking city gates. Fragments of ice were projected high into the sky, falling around the trackers like hail, while fine dust and ice mist reflected the sunlight, casting rainbow after rainbow.

Mist steamed in the air while heat radiated from bodies; the cold and warmth intertwined, colliding to form bursts of white vapor.

As the first batch of trackers exhausted their strength, a second batch immediately caught up, took over the burden, and continued to pull the icebreaker.

The first batch, having set down their heavy load, walked away quickly, eager to rest.

Only one person stood in place, unmoving.

His skin was dark brown, appearing extremely healthy, and his muscles bulged from years of hauling boats; his figure was well-proportioned.

What made him stand out even more like a crane among chickens was that while most other trackers had rough appearances and hunched backs, he alone stood perfectly straight with handsome features. At first glance, he didn't look like a tracker at all.

His name was Li Qi.

Li Qi, having just put down the tow rope, looked at the great ship and the frozen river before him with a sigh of admiration. Even though it was his third time seeing it, he still found it spectacular.

However, before he could finish his sigh, an old tracker beside him threw an arm around him, dragging away the dazed Li Qi who had been standing there admiring the scenery.

"Let's go, Little Li. It's the second shift's turn. Let's go drink a couple of mouthfuls of hot soup first!"

"Uh, ah... alright, Uncle Liu." Li Qi nodded and walked to the riverbank with the crowd of shirtless trackers who wore only loincloths.

Li Qi was also a tracker, but he was different from the others; his ancestors had not been trackers for generations.

On the shore, others had long since boiled hot soup and prepared clothes to warm the bodies of the trackers and sailors coming down from River Breaking. In a short while, once their strength recovered, they would have to go up for a second round.

Sitting together, the trackers changed their clothes, cupped their meat soup, and began to devour their food with slurping noises, their table manners unsightly.

Only Li Qi squatted by the river. Although he was also tired, covered in sweat, and bearing wounds from the tow ropes, he waited quietly, not rushing to fight for the meat soup boiled by the government officials.

Only when the crowded mass of people had grabbed their share did he walk up, collect his bowl, and return to the riverside. He sipped the soup in small mouthfuls while watching the other trackers pull the great ship.

"Brother Li! Here, I found a stool for you!" A tracker moved a stool over from the distance, though it was unclear where he had acquired it.

"Thanks for your trouble, but there's no need, no need. None of the guys have stools..." Li Qi was just about to say something when the tracker beside him pressed him down onto it.

"Uncle Liu has one too. Brother Li, don't decline. We got the lead position for this River Breaking thanks to you and Uncle Liu helping us. It's just a chair, why couldn't you sit on it?!"

"Exactly, exactly!"

"The lead position comes with a personal reward from the Lord Governor. Brother Li helped us get this spot, so what's wrong with sitting on a chair?"

"Right, right, right!"

"I feel the same!"

Seeing this, Li Qi no longer declined and sat down. While resting, he watched the second-shift trackers pull the great ship.

Unknowingly, he had already watched River Breaking three times.

It had been almost three years since he came to this world.

Yes, he was not a person of this world. Seeing that great ship, this sentiment rose in his heart once again.

That great ship likely had a displacement of several thousand tons, yet a mere one or two hundred trackers, combined with sails, could actually pull it and smash through the ice!

He looked again at the sinewy muscle on his own body. Even amidst a crowd of trackers, he didn't appear scrawny. As a former researcher, how could he have had this physique back then?

But here...

Thinking of this, he suddenly stood up and abruptly threw a punch!

The air seemed to compress, whistling with the punch, while dust kicked up nearby as if a heavy weight had struck the ground.

Seeing this, the other trackers praised him one after another.

"Brother Li's Wave-Shattering Force is truly handsome!"

"I've trained for ten years, yet I can't compare to Brother Li's two or three years of effort!"

"Nonsense, who are you? And who is Brother Li?"

The trackers laughed and joked, assuming Li Qi just felt like moving around a bit; they didn't find it strange.

Men, after all. Suddenly getting the urge to punch the air twice was simply natural law; it would be hard to believe there was anyone who hadn't done it.

But Li Qi was lamenting.

Over three years ago, his plane crashed. After losing consciousness, he found he had arrived here, and he had come in his original body. His pockets even contained a shattered game console and his travel backpack, though most of the contents had been burned, leaving only a few pieces of scrap iron.

He had transmigrated, and he brought his body with him.

Transmigration wasn't unheard of, but what about the promised inherited memories? What about the promised pre-existing identity?

He had nothing, not even a household registration.

Others brought smartphones with them; he only brought half a game console.

Fortunately, he met the local trackers, which counted as being saved. Coupled with the fact that he was a researcher and had at least some brains, he established a firm footing among the trackers. After gaining their trust, Uncle Liu taught him some of the strength-training methods passed down by the trackers' ancestors.

In just three short years, he could now carry large bales weighing seven or eight hundred jin and walk as if flying. He doubted if he was even human anymore. Could humans achieve this level through exercise?

Listening to Uncle Liu, the trackers' strength-training method was considered extremely crude. The techniques within the military, the government, and the sects were the ones called profound; they were not something trackers could compare to.

At the very beginning, he had been incredibly excited, thinking he could achieve great things with the knowledge in his brain!

Then he was ruthlessly slapped in the face by reality. He discovered that this place was terrifyingly developed, and there was no use for his petty cleverness...

He was good at mathematics, but within Li Prefecture City, there was a sect called the Thousand Mechanism Gate that specialized in divination and calculation. Their members calculated analysis tables in their heads, and their familiarity with probability theory was terrifying.

It was true there were no cars here, but the people here could travel a hundred li a day on their own two legs. He heard that wealthy families even had Spirit Horses, for which a thousand li a day was effortless.

And that was running on mountain roads. If there were a highway, would these horses be racing against F1 cars?

Yes, there truly wasn't much machinery here, but what was the need for machinery?

The strange rules here had led this world down a completely different path. Although there were few tools, almost all tools could be replaced by human power.

Trucks? Trackers could carry seven or eight hundred jin, and those strongmen could each carry two or three thousand jin of goods and work all day.

Precision machine tools? Li Qi had personally seen a craftsman carve a scene of a hundred warriors onto a grain of rice with a needle within a quarter of an hour just to show off his skill.

Do research? You must be joking. Regarding the aforementioned Thousand Mechanism Gate—setting aside their mental arithmetic capabilities—Li Qi heard that they weren't considered a major sect in Li Prefecture's upper echelons. Yet, when Li Qi listened to them recruiting members, he discovered that these people's research into probability theory and chaos algorithms far exceeded his own world; he couldn't even understand it.

Human power was infinitely magnified in this world. Through things like cultivation methods, humans completely replaced all tools; no tool was as useful as a human being.

Even regarding weapons, Li Qi believed that even if an entire modern army group were placed in this world, they would likely be wiped out by the Li Prefecture Martial Defense Corps.

He had seen those people from the Martial Defense Corps when he was pulling boats for important figures. Back then, the Commander of the Defense Corps performed a martial demonstration for the officials on the boat. Holding a long blade, he cut the five-li-wide Li River River, halting its flow for several seconds with a single slash.

That scene gave Li Qi nightmares for three nights.

Furthermore, productivity wasn't lacking at all.

What happened to the trope that otherworlders had brain damage and were still in an agrarian society after ten thousand years of development?

They were agrarian, yes, but the problem was, had you ever seen rice with a yield of three or four thousand jin per mu? And it was Spirit Rice, with terrifyingly high energy content. Initially, before Li Qi practiced the Wave-Shattering Force, he couldn't even eat half a bowl without feeling uncomfortably stuffed.

But now, three jin a meal was only considered half-full.

It was just that he couldn't get meat.

Because there was almost no livestock industry in this world, meat relied basically on hunting. However, the cost of hunting was very high, so only during festivals, like the current River Breaking, could one eat a bit of minced meat and meat soup.

Precisely because of this, those trackers ate like starving ghosts.

There was almost no livestock farming. Li Qi initially thought this was a business opportunity, but after trying it, he gave up.

In this world, since the humans were so fierce, the wild beasts were oddly fierce as well. A pig was like a tank, extremely difficult to domesticate on a large scale. Li Qi hadn't seen a tiger in this world, but he estimated that dismantling a Gundam wouldn't be much of a problem for one.

So far, the only domesticated animals he had seen were the Spirit Horses that occasionally appeared at the docks.

He heard there were demon beasts and spirit beasts, but that was too far removed from Li Qi. As a tracker, belonging to the lowest tier of society, he had no chance to witness them.

It wasn't that he wasn't ambitious. For the first two years, he hadn't given up on climbing up the ladder, hoping to become a protagonist-like figure.

However, in such a world, cultivation methods were inevitably the most precious resource.

People relied on cultivation methods to gather into one small group after another.

For example, in Li Prefecture City, there were three tracker gangs: their Wave-Rowing Gang, and the other two called the Water Horse Gang and the Strong Force Gang. Combined, there were seven or eight hundred trackers.

The three gangs guarded their internal cultivation methods with extreme strictness. One could only be granted the right to practice the cultivation method and officially become a gang member after undergoing background checks, providing a certificate of loyalty, and being observed for a long time.

Afterward, one had to swear blood oaths and sign contracts not to leak the cultivation method. If there was a traitor, not only would there be internal punishment, but the government even had clear regulations: leaking a cultivation method after signing a contract was forbidden. The punishment was extremely heavy, often involving exile of thirty thousand li—and who knew how big this continent actually was.

Under these circumstances, the small groups in every city divided the population according to cultivation methods. The solidification between various gangs and groups was simply unbelievable. It was impossible for him to learn another family's cultivation method.

In three years, aside from relying on his brain to mix into the position of a strategist within the Wave-Rowing Gang and earning the respect of one or two hundred trackers, he had truly achieved nothing.

"Sigh..." Thinking of this, he sighed.

Mediocre and unaccomplished. Although he could eat his fill of rice every day, he had to think twice about adding vegetables. As for meat... that relied entirely on the rewards from the big shots above.

He had transmigrated, and life seemed to have gotten worse... aside from his body becoming a bit stronger.

Oh, more than a bit.

It was just that he was somewhat unwilling to accept this.

"Uncle Li, Sixth Lord is looking for you!" Just at this moment, a child ran over leading another tracker who looked forty or fifty years old, shouting to Li Qi.

As this child shouted, he drooled uncontrollably.

Seeing the child's appearance, Li Qi was amused. Smiling, he handed over the half-bowl of meat soup he hadn't finished.

"Alright, look at you. Take it. Remember to return the bowl after you finish drinking!"

The child let out a 'waa', jumped up happily, grabbed the bowl, and drank it down along with the saliva that had just flowed out. He smacked his lips, chewing the minced meat inside, even forgetting to say thank you.

However, the old tracker called Uncle Liu frowned when he saw the child. He placed a stool beside Li Qi and sat down.

"We don't get to eat meat a few times a year, yet you gave it to him just for leading the way?"

"I've been caught in the rain, so I'll hold an umbrella for others. I've starved, so I know the value of a casual bowl of soup. If Uncle Liu hadn't given me a bowl of soup back then, wouldn't I have died too?" Li Qi laughed casually.

Then, he turned to business. "Alright, let's not talk about this. Uncle Liu, what did you need me for?"

"What I gave back then was vegetable soup!" Uncle Liu grumbled a sentence, but it didn't delay matters. He immediately brought up the main topic.

"Little Li, you're relatively smart. Help me figure this out; we seem to have run into trouble."
