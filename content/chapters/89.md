# Chapter 89: The Dust Settles

An Invocator was renowned for their combat prowess.

Why? Because Heavenly Gods, Earthly Divinities, and Human Ghosts all offered them their blessing. Deities from all four directions protected them, and local ghost spirits accompanied them. They could borrow the power of heaven, earth, mountains, rivers, and ancestral spirits.

So, did Li Qi currently have any deities blessing him?

Of course he did.

Disregarding the ethereal Heavenly Gods of the Four Seasons, and setting aside the unreliable five household gods.

The only Human Ghost he could presently rely on was Old Man Li, the Rank 8 dead man who had agreed to forgive the Wang family after Li Qi's mediation.

The spirit had not broken his word. Before departing, he bestowed upon Li Qi the blessing of a Ghostly God: three wisps of ghost qi.

What use did this ghost qi have?

Bewitching the soul!

Ghost qi could force a person into agonizing sluggishness. By harnessing the aura of the dead and hurling it, the victim's soul qi would scatter in panic, unable to remain tethered to their body!

With the divine soul untethered from the flesh, the result was a hollow stupor and a temporary loss of all reactive capability. Without sufficiently unyielding willpower and fortitude, it was absolutely impossible to resist!

Li Qi had used this exact method to launch a sneak attack, wiping out every Mount Bo Sect disciple present without making a single sound.

The same was true now!

He relied on a dead man's head to draw attention, then struck from behind!

The purpose of this sneak attack was not to land a lethal blow, but to serve as a secondary distraction.

He did not believe that Bao Dun would fail to sense his assault.

Clearly, Li Qi's assumption was correct.

Bao Dun perceived the ambush from his rear. His metal qi instantly intensified, and a metallic-hued cyclone materialized around him. Like a meat grinder, it chewed at the willow branch, producing a harsh, grinding screech.

Yet, the willow branch proved extraordinarily resilient. Though it was subjected to constant grinding and its kinetic force was bled away—rendering it unable to deal lethal damage—the metal qi fundamentally failed to harm the branch itself.

This item was Li Qi's greatest reliance while walking the Jianghu.

It appeared to be an ordinary willow branch, but it had been infused with divine qi by a genuine Grand Invocator, and further nourished by Li Qi channeling the divine qi of the five household gods into it. While it had little effect on the physical body, it possessed immense power against the divine soul!

With the willow branch blocked, Li Qi's objective was achieved.

Bao Dun had focused all of his vital energy into fending off the willow branch.

Upon successfully parrying it, a surge of joy rose in his heart.

However, he immediately realized the truth and roared, "You aren't using a saber!? You wield a whip?!"

Unfortunately, Li Qi ignored him. While Bao Dun wasted his vital energy fending off the willow branch, Li Qi had already hurled the ghost qi.

His attention had been split twice in rapid succession. As the saying goes, bad things come in threes; this time, he ultimately failed to react.

The Rank 8 ghost qi surged directly into his body!

His divine soul destabilized, leaving his soul qi unmoored. This was the state of a plummeting form and a wandering soul—departing but not perishing, like a bird abandoning its nest or a snake shedding its skin. His body became an empty vessel, rendering it impossible to mount a defense!

Seeing this, Li Qi decisively stepped forward and lashed out with another whip strike.

One must not forget: this willow branch specialized in striking the divine soul!

A single lash directly shattered half of his divine soul!

It was just like the time he fought that Rank 9 Military lineage officer. That man had voluntarily split his divine soul to imbue his long saber, which was why a single strike from Li Qi's whip knocked him unconscious on the spot.

The same held true now. With Bao Dun's soul untethered and leaking outward, the whip strike caused him to instantly bleed from his seven facial orifices. He curled into a ball of sheer agony, looking as if he had been strapped to an electric chair and shocked with a hundred thousand volts.

With that, the domain of metal qi surrounding him dissipated completely.

Li Qi didn't hesitate. _Crack! Crack!_ Two more lashes violently scattered the remainder of Bao Dun's leaking divine soul. Simultaneously, he channeled his brute strength. The already activated Ox Strength Art expelled a puff of white steam as he charged forward, planting a heavy stomp directly onto Bao Dun's neck.

With a sickening crunch, the neck was crushed flat. It was evident the man could no longer survive.

But someone like Li Qi would weigh the decision to act over and over again, even appearing somewhat indecisive beforehand. Yet, the moment he resolved to strike, he absolutely ensured no loose ends remained!

He stomped down once more, but the opponent's skull was so incredibly hard that it actually sprained his ankle.

"So hard..." Li Qi muttered. He swapped his weapon for one of the Mount Bo Sect's own swords and viciously hacked at the neck.

As he hacked, he realized the sword blade had chipped and curled, yet it still couldn't sever the spine.

Slicing open the flesh for a closer look, he discovered that despite Bao Dun's fat appearance, his bones were like vajra steel. Metal qi had permeated his skeleton, granting it an extreme toughness that felt sharp enough to cut the hand that touched it.

Li Qi's heart chilled with awe as he recognized the true extent of Bao Dun's strength.

If they had truly clashed head-on, Li Qi figured the man could have battered him to a pulp with his bare hands. With that terrifying physique and the frightful metal qi domain, this brute could likely take on three or more fighters of Li Qi's caliber simultaneously. Li Qi would have struggled to even scratch him; merely getting close would have meant being ground into dumpling filling by the metal qi domain.

What a pity for him. Li Qi was not a close-combat warrior; he was an Invocator, a spellcaster.

It was common knowledge that warriors were destined to be strung up and beaten by spellcasters.

His divine soul was forced out by ghost qi, leaving his body untethered. Compounded by the willow branch lashing his soul, this deadly combo rendered his steel bones and iron flesh utterly useless. With his divine soul shattered, he was reduced to nothing but a fleshy husk waiting to be butchered.

Seeing that he couldn't decapitate the corpse, Li Qi grabbed yet another sword, pierced the man's heart, and thoroughly scrambled his internal organs into mush. Only upon confirming his death did he finally stop.

It couldn't be helped. In a world brimming with demons, monsters, and ghosts, one had to take precautions.

Who could say? If he didn't tie up every loose end, the corpse might just spring back to life.

Within the five organs resided the qi of the Five Constant Virtues. The reason a person possessed intelligence and wisdom was due to containing this qi. When a person died, their five organs rotted; with that decay, the Five Constant Virtues lost their vessel, and the foundation of their intellect was destroyed.

Human intellect stemmed from the Five Constant Virtues. Death brought the decay of the five organs, leaving the qi of the Five Constant Virtues without a home. It was at this point that a ghost would lose its sanity.

Mutilating the corpse achieved this exact purpose. By destroying the physical vessel, it became nearly impossible for the ghost to sustain itself.

Furthermore, his divine soul had been pulverized by the willow branch. He could forget about reincarnation; he would directly dissolve and become one with heaven and earth.

Having finished his gruesome work, Li Qi cleaned up the scene. He hadn't sustained any bleeding injuries, so he only needed to wipe away his footprints and handprints. Then, he gathered his spoils, tossed some kindling onto a fire, and set the pleasure boat ablaze.

He took nothing with him, ensuring he would be much harder to track.

Following that, he immediately dove into the Li River, remaining submerged as he rode the current out of the city.

The entire process was completed without a single commotion.

In his wake, the pleasure boat erupted into a towering inferno, its flames casting heavy shadows. Frantic shouts of "Fire!" and "Put it out!" echoed endlessly through the night.

But Li Qi cared not. He swam swiftly through the pitch-black waters dozens of meters deep, returning to the Wave-Rowing Gang to retrieve his long saber and bamboo basket. Then, he picked up a heavy stone, smashed Vegetable Head Zhang's skull, and scattered his divine soul.

He then slipped back into the water, flowing along the river until he was entirely out of the city limits.

Sixth Uncle was a steady and reliable man; there was no need to worry about him. Li Qi had already left all necessary instructions, handed over the cultivation method for Carp Stream Intent, and gifted them six pieces of gold. His business with the Wave-Rowing Gang was finally concluded.

He swam a long distance before finally wading ashore. Stepping into the dense woods, he let out a long, echoing whistle.

Mere minutes later, Old Ma came galloping through the trees, carrying Shen Shuibi on its back.

"Ah, you're back? Are we leaving now?" Shen Shuibi asked.

"We go! And this time, we aren't stopping!" Li Qi swept his arm outward and vaulted onto the horse.
