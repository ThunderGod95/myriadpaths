# Chapter 56: Martial Dao

Li Qi felt a sliver of 'qi' being forcefully squeezed from his flesh and blood, but the moment this sliver of qi emerged, his entire body instantly went limp.

"Li Qi, you are awake?!" Shen Shuibi's voice suddenly rang in his ears.

Her tone sounded incredibly anxious, yet there was an underlying sense of profound relief.

Li Qi opened his eyes, only to find her holding him tightly. Where their skin touched, he could feel a smooth, soft sensation. Though he was covered in a greasy layer of sweat, none of it seemed to stick to Shen Shuibi, leaving him with a peculiar feeling.

"Thank goodness... I almost thought you were never going to wake up. Do you have any idea? Yin qi from the Nether Court was surging up just now, almost dragging you away!" Seeing Li Qi awake, Shen Shuibi hurriedly got off him and straightened her disheveled dress.

"Yin qi from the Nether Court... then truly, thank you, Miss Shen." Li Qi remained somewhat listless, feeling so weak that he could not even move.

Still, he had woken up at the very least.

From Shen Shuibi's words, combined with his previous bizarre dreams, he immediately understood exactly what had transpired during that half-awake, half-asleep illusion.

It was a simple deduction.

The Yin qi of the Nether Court had tried to drag him down, meaning he had likely been on the verge of true death.

Therefore, Shen Shuibi had held him close, using the nature of her Unsullied Body—which repelled all corruption—to block those streams of Yin qi, buying him the precious time needed to save himself.

He really had to thank her, or else he probably would have actually died this time.

And now... it was time to assess the current situation.

Forcing himself upward, Li Qi struggled to sit up from the ground.

Only then did he realize he was in a forest clearing, resting on a canvas spread, while a messy layer of bandages was wrapped around his chest.

They were bandages, right? They were made of linen and, by the looks of it, had been torn directly from Shen Shuibi’s dress.

After all, her long dress had been reduced to a calf-length, cropped skirt.

She must have been keeping an ear on the situation while riding Old Ma, staying close by. That was how she had been able to charge out at the critical moment and kick that soldier to death.

Old Ma was quite reliable, and though Shen Shuibi could be a bit dense, she pulled through when it counted.

If it had not been for those two, he truly would have perished.

While Li Qi was observing his surroundings, Shen Shuibi was crouching on the other side, tending to a cooking pot.

Something seemed to be stewing inside, bubbling away, undoubtedly prepared by Shen Shuibi.

She must have been getting it ready the moment she noticed Li Qi was awake.

Since they lacked proper tableware and Li Qi usually ate straight from the pot anyway, she brought the entire thing over.

It looked scalding hot, but with her Unsullied Body, she was impervious to heat and cold. Extreme temperatures seemed to have no effect on her, so even as she carried the boiling iron pot with her bare hands, she felt absolutely nothing, her skin remaining tender and smooth.

Carrying the pot over, Shen Shuibi placed it in front of Li Qi and crouched down. Using the spoon he normally ate with, she fed him a bite and said, "Li Qi, you are truly amazing! To think that you, an unranked, actually managed to kill a Rank Nine Military lineage cultivator. Even by the Lady's side, I have never seen anyone like you!"

"I only had the advantage of the terrain. Besides, he didn't even use most of his strength on me; he was using a formation to sever the mountain roots and water veins." Li Qi shook his head, not believing he had accomplished this purely through his own strength.

That officer, that Rank Nine Military lineage cultivator—if they had fought fairly on level ground, a single strike would have likely lopped off Li Qi's head, leaving him with absolutely no ability to resist.

After forming an array with his subordinates, the man could even temporarily sever the connections to the mountains and rivers, preventing others from borrowing their power.

Fortunately, Li Qi had absolutely no idea how to draw power from the landscape in the first place, meaning the man's precautions were entirely in vain.

This was completely standard practice; when facing an Invocator from Shaman God Mountain who had displayed the Ox Strength Art, immediately cutting off their means of drawing upon the land was undoubtedly the correct move.

It was just that this officer never expected Li Qi to be a useless amateur who had taken up the practice halfway.

He simply did not know how to do it.

Coupled with the geographical advantage of the deep pool and the sudden trump card of the willow branch, Li Qi had only barely managed to turn the tables.

It was truly a narrow escape, far from something he had the right to be smug about—especially since he currently had a hole in his chest and was lying paralyzed on the ground.

"You did it, and that's that. It doesn't matter what you relied on. That is what the Lady always said," Shen Shuibi remarked, feeding Li Qi another spoonful.

Li Qi took a look; it appeared to be porridge boiled with sticky rice cakes.

She had mashed the rice cakes and tossed in the mountain goods he had traded for earlier—wood ear mushrooms, shiitake, and the like—along with cured meat, coarse salt, and some wild herbs from who knows where, stewing it all together.

It was a fine pot of meat porridge. Incredibly aromatic, it stirred a profound appetite within Li Qi's weakened body.

He swallowed a spoonful impatiently, but it was nowhere near enough, leaving him eagerly waiting for Shen Shuibi to feed him more.

He had no other choice; he could not even lift his arms. His entire body ached with exhaustion, and the blade wound on his chest was constantly seeping blood, throbbing with unbearable pain.

Shen Shuibi understood his need, offering him one bite after another. She fed him so rapidly that they didn't even care about the scalding heat as he slurped it all down.

Thank goodness for his sturdy constitution, otherwise, he likely wouldn't have even had the energy to eat and regain his strength.

"You suffered external injuries and forcefully overtaxed your body to generate a sliver of inner qi, so you need to eat plenty of meat. Because of that, I boiled all the meat in your bag," Shen Shuibi explained while feeding him.

These words caught Li Qi completely off guard, making him stop his frantic chewing.

"Wait, forcefully taxing my physique to generate a sliver of inner qi?" Li Qi asked in response.

"Yes. Did you not know? But didn't you do that yourself?" Shen Shuibi was also a bit puzzled.

"I have no idea. What is that? I was just trying to save myself; I don't understand the principles behind it." Li Qi decisively asked for her guidance.

Although Shen Shuibi could be a bit slow on the uptake, her reservoir of knowledge was truly unquestionable.

When Li Qi asked, she readily answered, "This is the cultivation method of the Martial Dao's martial combat path. Unlike the Shaman Dao, which integrates external qi into the personal cosmos, they believe the human body itself is the strongest and requires no external qi."

"Therefore, practitioners of the Martial Dao do not draw qi into their bodies. Instead, they rely on eating. They eat all kinds of spirit beasts, consume myriad types of qi, and sometimes even devour people. Regardless, after eating, they digest these things through their personal cosmos and then refine them into a unified 'inner qi,' which they use in combat."

"Different ways of eating gave rise to different branches. The Martial Dao tradition also possesses many cultivation methods that simply teach people how to eat. Besides cultivation methods, there are also various combat styles. The Martial Dao excels at close-quarters combat and can employ many unimaginable martial skills, meaning their frontal combat capabilities are incredibly formidable. You must have a Martial Dao cultivation method on you as well, right?"

"A Martial Dao cultivation method..." Li Qi looked down at himself.

Could the Wave-Shattering Force actually be a Martial Dao cultivation method?
