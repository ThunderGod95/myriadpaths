# Chapter 71: Entering... the Ranks?

Shen Shuibi began to explain her intentions to Li Qi.

"In spring, the Wood begins to rule, and liver qi begins to rise. Liver qi is urgent; its wind is swift." She habitually started reciting from ancient texts.

This meant that during spring, Wood qi governed the season. In the human body, this manifested as the emergence of liver qi, characterized by its restlessness, as swift and changeable as the wind.

"Li Qi, your liver qi is vigorous because you frequently use Great Forest Wood qi, granting you abundant vitality. However, this isn't entirely a good thing. Excessive vitality can easily spur the growth of tumors, much like how a growing tree develops branching forks. This is the result of surplus life force."

"But your cultivation base is still shallow; you are nowhere near that stage. By slowly accumulating the qi of the four seasons later on, you could naturally harmonize it. Therefore, I didn't say much about it before. Now, though, it seems this has become an advantage."

Shen Shuibi continued, "Those that lurk in the dark, capable of both surviving and perishing, are the turtle and the dragon. The turtle is born in water and revealed by fire. Thus, it becomes the prophet of all things, the arbiter of fortune and disaster. This is the wondrous origin of the dragon and the turtle."

Li Qi understood this passage. The entities hiding in the gloom, capable of persisting or vanishing, were ancient turtles and dragons.

Turtles lived in water, and their shells were scorched with fire during divination. The union of water and fire allowed them to serve as the seers of existence, verifying omens of good and ill.[^1]

"Therefore, the underlying principle is the same. When water gathers in plants and trees, the roots reach their proper depth, the flowers bloom in appropriate numbers, and the fruits yield their expected weight. This is because the internal measure of water is optimal," Shen Shuibi elaborated.[^2]

When water nourished flora, the roots could delve deep, the blooms could flourish in abundance, and the fruit could grow heavy. This all stemmed from the plants retaining the correct balance of water within.

"The earth is the origin of all things, the root of all life. By using your body as the earth and planting wood within it, we can gather water to follow its natural affinity." Shen Shuibi's tone grew slightly excited as she spoke.

"I will use the wood qi in your liver as a guide, combining it with your kidney qi and lung qi. Water qi gives rise to great wood. Thus, the kidneys represent the Utmost Yin; the Utmost Yin holds abundant water. The lungs represent the Supreme Yin. The Lesser Yin connects to the winter meridian. Therefore, the root lies in the kidneys, and the terminus lies in the lungs. The lungs belong to the Metal element. Metal generates water, and water qi tempers Metal. In this way, three of your five viscera will be fortified by the water qi."[^3]

"As a result, your physique will become robust, and your internal qi will overflow. Your Martial Dao will be able to break straight into Rank 9!" Shen Shuibi said cheerfully, genuinely thrilled that Li Qi could advance so quickly.

As for Li Qi himself... he looked completely bewildered.

Had he understood her?

It seemed... he had?

But then again, maybe not.

Whatever. Shen Shuibi was at Rank 5. She undoubtedly knew more than him. Moreover, she never lied and treated him with absolute sincerity. It was best to just follow her instructions.

"So, what do I need to do?" Li Qi asked straightforwardly.

"You don't need to do anything. Just sit down. Leave the rest to me!" Moving briskly, Shen Shuibi walked up to Li Qi, grabbed his hand, and led him to a flat patch of ground nearby.

Two hours later.

Li Qi stared blankly at his own hands.

His internal qi was so abundant that it could no longer be described as mere 'strands,' but rather as rushing 'currents.'

Rank 9 of the Martial Dao... he had achieved it?

Just like that?

What happened to entering the ranks being incredibly difficult?

Li Qi stood up, channeled the Carp Stream Intent, and threw a punch.

The wind howled! His kidney qi pumped, his liver qi boiled, and his lung qi distilled, converging into a surge of internal qi that flooded into his fist.

This single punch struck with the imposing momentum of a thunderbolt!

The wind from the strike converged into a single force as his fist smashed directly into a massive log. It snapped a tree as thick as a man's embrace right in half. Astoundingly, his hand remained completely unscathed. Only his heart pounded slightly in his chest, though nothing serious. He could sustain this level of combat for roughly five or six minutes.

"Hmm... it is still a bit flawed. A proper Rank 9 of the Martial Dao requires the refinement of all five viscera. Right now, you've only strengthened three, so there is inevitably some deficiency. But we can make up for it later."

"I've planned it all out. It is spring now. When summer arrives, as the ancient texts state: 'In summer, fire takes command. Heart qi begins to grow, extending inward to the meridians.' This means that in the summer, Fire qi governs the season, and heart qi flourishes. At that time, when you offer sacrifices to the Heavenly Gods of the four seasons, you must switch to the Vermilion Bird!"

"Then, by drawing upon the Heaven of the Three Qi in the South and the fire of the Fire Official Yinghuo, we can stimulate your heart qi and complete the tempering of your heart. Once four of the viscera are formed, all you will need to do is train your spleen. The four elements will nourish the Earth, achieving ultimate harmony. You will naturally attain a complete Rank 9!"[^4]

Shen Shuibi spoke with her usual beaming smile, looking every bit like an adorable little rabbit.

But Li Qi's face was entirely numb.

What was he supposed to say?

Old Madam Wang had trained for at least fifty years of her life, yet she had never managed to enter the ranks.

Meanwhile, Shen Shuibi had simply pondered for a moment, utilized those thirty strands of pure water qi alongside the Great Forest Wood qi he had recently accumulated, and effortlessly pushed his martial cultivation into Rank 9. Albeit a flawed Rank 9.

He was at a loss for words.

When shock reaches its absolute peak, there is actually no outward reaction. Li Qi felt incapable of forming any other expression.

It turned out that when a certain emotion hits its limit, a person simply goes numb, devoid of any other feeling.

What was this called?

It reminded Li Qi of a story.

`The one where drawing a single line costs $1.

Knowing exactly where to draw that line costs $9,999.`

A Rank 5 expert truly lived up to the reputation.

In cultivation, people were truly incomparable. With an esteemed master's guidance, the results weren't just twice the outcome for half the effort.

It was an exponential multiplication.

Li Qi could not help but sigh in awe.

What others chased for a lifetime, he had accomplished after stepping onto the path of cultivation a mere month ago.

The disparity between people was truly greater than the gap between a human and a dog.

He did not ask Shen Shuibi how exactly she had achieved this, knowing full well he wouldn't understand the answer.

Shen Shuibi's explanations only covered the most superficial principles. It was like trying to teach the theory of relativity to a primary school student—you could toss out concepts like the twin paradox, length contraction, and time dilation to provide a rough idea of the theory.

But as for the rigorous proofs and actual implementation... no matter how much you explained, if the listener lacked the foundation, they simply wouldn't grasp it.

Though he had witnessed Shen Shuibi's vast erudition many times, she still managed to leave Li Qi deeply humbled on every occasion.

True, Shen Shuibi was innocent, adorable, and endearingly naive.

But she was absolutely no fool. On the contrary, she possessed profoundly extensive knowledge and an agile mind. Her personality was merely unblemished and pure.

Li Qi took a deep breath, calming his internal qi to savor his newfound strength.

The greatest change after reaching Rank 9 was the newfound resilience of his internal organs.

With his viscera tempered, his stamina became incredibly enduring. For instance, with his Lesser Yin lungs tempered by water qi, holding his breath for two full hours would be no problem at all.

The tempering of his Supreme Yin kidneys had vastly reinforced his metabolic system. According to Shen Shuibi, ordinary toxins would no longer affect him, and the muscle soreness following intense exertion would fade rapidly.

The liver governed blood. Now, his qi and blood were teeming. With abundant vitality, his physical constitution was over ten times stronger than before.

In short, he had crossed the threshold of Rank 9 just like that.

Li Qi remained frozen in place, utterly speechless.

[^1]: [The Profound Dao of the Dragon and the Turtle](/myriadpaths/mythology/turtle-and-dragon/)
[^2]: This is a terrible leap in logic here. The connection Shen Shuibi is making hinges on one core concept: _Water as the ultimate source of hidden potential, and how the precise measure of it dictates a perfect outcome._

    The Turtle is born in water. It absorbs the deep wisdom of the world here.
    
    The Turtle is HIM.
[^3]:
    **Don't read this until you've finished the chapter.**
    
    Shen Shuibi has pivoted away from the turtles and trees talk, and I honestly can’t be bothered to write another exhaustive breakdown.

    Li had been over-relying on Wood qi. Since Wood is tied to the Liver and represents raw life force, his energy was essentially growing like a weed. Left unchecked, that chaotic growth would have eventually manifested as tumors or physical mutations.
    
    Suddenly, Li Qi acquires thirty strands of incredibly pure Water qi. Shen Shuibi looks at this and realizes she can use this premium shit to fix his overgrown Liver and force a massive power-up.
    
    The organs feed into each other in this specific order: **Metal** → **Water** → **Wood**.
    
    Shen Shuibi forces Li Qi's body into this exact chain.
    
    The Lungs are the intake. They breathe in qi and naturally generate Water qi. Shen Shuibi uses his Lungs to process the new, pure Water qi he just found.
    
    The Kidneys are the tank. The processed Water qi flows down from the Lungs and is stored safely in the Kidneys.
    
    The Kidneys then act like a sprinkler, feeding that perfect Water qi into the overgrown Liver.
    
    Instead of the Liver's Wood qi growing out of control like a weed, the pure Water qi tames it. It organizes the chaotic energy into deep, strong roots. Because the Lungs, Kidneys, and Liver are suddenly working together in a perfect, frictionless loop (breathe → store → nourish), those three organs instantly upgrade. Li Qi skips decades of normal martial arts training—like Old Madam Wang did—and instantly hits Rank 9.
    
    It’s considered a flawed Rank 9 because he still has two organs left to upgrade (the Heart and Spleen), but he just bypassed years of grinding by using a shortcut.
    
    Now, if you really want to understand allat in detail, you should start your research in this direction:
    
    * Understand the Five Elements Theory (Wu Xing)
    * Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) specifically how the five viscera map to the five elements.
    * The Six Channel Theory (Liu Jing), which categorizes the depth and stages of Yin and Yang in the body.
    
    You will find the concepts of the Five Viscera, the elemental mappings, and the interactions of Yin and Yang in Huangdi Neijing, a foundation textbook on TCM.
[^4]: Fire is the element of heart and is represented by the South direction.
    
    Fire Official Yinghuo is the literal name of the planet Mars in Chinese cosmolgy.
    
    Why does it represent Fire? Because it is red. Red is Fire. Yinghuo translates to Fire Star. Ying = Star; Huo = Fire.

    Earth is the center of the five elements, and the last in the cycle.
    
    All other elements feed into it.
