# Chapter 35: Cultivation

The discussion regarding Defensive Qi and Nutritive Qi left Li Qi completely bewildered.

_What is all this? I don't understand any of it…_

He only understood that she had destroyed her own foundation; that was why her cultivation had dispersed.

No wonder she was so weak. So that was the reason.

Noticing the confusion in Li Qi's eyes, Shen Shuibi explained, "The _Spiritual Pivot_ states: 'The body receives water and grain, transforming them into vital substances... This qi enters the five viscera internally and connects to the limbs and joints externally. The floating qi that does not follow the meridians is Defensive Qi; the refined qi that travels within the meridians is Nutritive Qi. Yin and Yang follow each other, penetrating outside and inside, like an endless ring. It accumulates and flows so purely—who can fully fathom its limits?'"

"What this means is that the refined substances transformed from food and drink enter the five viscera internally and distribute to the limbs and joints externally. That which floats outside and does not run within the meridians is Defensive Qi, and that which runs within the meridians is Nutritive Qi. Defensive Qi belongs to Yang, while Nutritive Qi belongs to Yin; they follow each other, connecting inside and out, circulating within the body like a ring, repeating endlessly without rest."

"The last sentence—'It accumulates and flows so purely, who can fully fathom its limits?'—simply asks: regarding the movement of Nutritive and Defensive Qi, how can one ever thoroughly understand it?"

"Both the Medicine Schools and the Daoist Sects do not know the full laws of Nutritive and Defensive Qi, so they only left the phrase 'who can fully fathom its limits?'" Shen Shuibi explained. "Therefore, since my Defensive Qi was implanted with that thing, there was no other option but to destroy my cultivation."

"I was afraid they would find me and gain clues about the Lady through me, so I simply scrapped my cultivation, expelling all Defensive and Nutritive Qi to reconstitute the cycle. Only then did I throw those things out."[^1]

But at that moment, the rabbit suddenly slapped her forehead as if struck by enlightenment, abruptly remembering something. "Right! And after that, I was captured by you people! By that Grand Invocator!"

Li Qi was completely caught off guard by this turn of events.

_How could she possibly remember that at a time like this?!_

"In that case, isn't Lady Luofu safe now?" Li Qi said hastily.

"Why?" Shen Shuibi's expression turned wary.

"You know as well as I do that Shaman God Mountain is an enemy of the Tang Empire. We wouldn't capture Lady Luofu just to hand her over to the Tang, would we? On the contrary, Lady Luofu could take refuge on Shaman God Mountain, and the Tang Empire could never attack her there, right?"

"If we go find Lady Luofu, then she'll definitely be safe!" Li Qi said. "Miss Shen, don't you think that makes sense?"

"Well… I suppose so." Shen Shuibi thought it over carefully and realized it seemed to make sense.

"So, let's rest for one night and then set out to find Lady Luofu. The sooner we find her, the sooner she'll be safe." Li Qi relentlessly drove this point home.

Between their earlier conversation and her initial impression of him, Shen Shuibi was starting to waver.

Li Qi immediately pressed on, continuing his spiel.

Time passed slowly, and the moon gradually rose.

In short, by the time the moon hung over the treetops, Shen Shuibi had finally been coaxed into agreeing to travel with him.

This rabbit, though learned and possessor of a great memory, was still quite dense and easy to fool.

Moreover, for Li Qi, there was an added piece of good news.

Because Shen Shuibi saw that Li Qi had nowhere to sleep, she took him back to the inn with her.

It was the first time in his life Li Qi had ever stayed at an inn.

He had to admit it.

It was awesome.

The next day arrived.

The sky was not yet bright, still full of stars, when Li Qi awoke.

It wasn't that he was anxious to set off or to mooch a meal from Ba Kui, but because, in his mind, the cultivation method recorded in [Invocation] required him to cultivate at this specific time daily.

This book really was just a book inside his head. Aside from not needing to hold it in his hands and not worrying about losing it, it was exactly like a real book.

It wasn't a memory, nor was it a database with a search function, but simply, plainly, a book.

Want to know the knowledge inside?

Fine, then you have to open it yourself, read it slowly, and memorize it bit by bit.

Li Qi figured that he probably wouldn't be able to finish reading it all within five years.

However, the one upside was that the cultivation method itself was actually quite short. There wasn't anything complex; summarized, it was extracting the many different qis of heaven and earth, channeling them into the inner cosmos, nurturing the inner divinity, and sacrificing to the myriad gods.

Depending on the chosen path, the main focus of the sacrifices would also differ.

It still came down to those three major categories: Heavenly Gods, Earthly Divinities, and Human Ghosts. These were the three different focuses for sacrificing to the gods within the small cosmos of the human body.

Because of Young Master Zhu, Li Qi naturally stepped into the Earthly Divinity branch.

However, it was really just a matter of focus; in practice, he still had to cultivate all three branches, just with different levels of effort dedicated to each.

And the cultivation method was very fantastical.

Because it was currently spring, he should now be sacrificing to the Azure Dragon of the Twenty-Eight Mansions.

The 'Twenty-Eight Mansions' are divided into four major groups according to the four cardinal directions, giving rise to the 'Four Symbols': the Azure Dragon of the East, the White Tiger of the West, the Vermilion Bird of the South, and the Black Tortoise of the North.

Among the Twenty-Eight Mansions, the seven mansions of Jiao, Kang, Di, Fang, Xin, Wei, and Ji form a draconic asterism, which people call the Azure Dragon of the East. The Jiao mansion represents the dragon's horn, Kang its throat, Di its claws, Xin its heart, and Wei and Ji its tail.

The records describe the dragon as "able to be hidden or visible, minuscule or massive, short or long; ascending to the heavens at the spring equinox and hiding in the abyss at the autumn equinox," which is actually describing the changes in the Azure Dragon constellation.

The Azure Dragon constellation rises from the eastern night sky in spring and sets in the west in autumn; its cycle of appearance and its position correspond precisely with the annual agricultural cycle.

When farming begins in spring, the Azure Dragon constellation starts to rise in the eastern night sky, revealing its bright head. In summer, as the crops grow, the Azure Dragon hangs in the southern night sky. In autumn, when the harvest is plentiful, the Azure Dragon also begins to set in the west. In winter, when all life lies dormant, the Azure Dragon is hidden below the northern horizon.

At this moment, at the junction of winter and spring, the Azure Dragon constellation was beginning to emerge from the east; the Jiao mansion, representing the dragon's horn, was starting to appear above the eastern horizon.

When the Azure Dragon constellation appeared fully in the sky, it would be the official start of the spring plowing season.

This is what is commonly known as "On the second day of the second month, the dragon raises its head."

This point in time was for sacrificing to one of the Heavenly Gods, the "Azure Dragon of the East," also known as Qinglong.

"Of the Heavenly Gods, none is more noble than the Azure Dragon." The Azure Dragon itself is the head of the Four Symbols. Sacrificing to the Azure Dragon at this time would allow one to obtain the qi of the east, which could fill the small cosmos of the human body and sustain the divinity within.

That was why Li Qi crawled up at three or four in the morning, struggling to rise from the warm covers.

How could sleeping possibly compare to cultivation?

This was cultivation!

The path to becoming better, the path to no longer being a boat tracker!

So, he immediately arranged his posture and began the sacrifice to the Azure Dragon.

This was a sacrifice to a Heavenly God.

Afterward, he still needed to sacrifice to the Earthly Divinities.

Only when all of that was finished would his cultivation for the day be complete, and he would officially join the ranks of cultivators!

He thought this as he gazed at his own progress bar.

But as he watched, Li Qi suddenly realized something.

Having grown accustomed to the progress bar appearing anytime and anywhere, he realized… a progress bar had never appeared on Young Master Zhu.

    This is basically a Catch-22 situation. The spell art from the pursuers disguised itself as her body's natural immune system (Defensive Qi). Because the immune system is inextricably linked to the life-support system (Nutritive Qi), Shen Shuibi cannot remove the effects of the spell art. The only way to stop the spell from tracking her and eating her energy is to nuke her entire energy system, effectively destroying her cultivation entirely.

    Quite sinister, ain't it?

[^2]:
    In Chinese astrology, the sky is not divided by the 12 solar zodiac signs used in the West, but by the 28 Lunar Mansions (or _Xiu_). These "mansions" track the Moon's movement through the sky over the course of a lunar month (approx. 27.3 days).

    The 28 mansions are grouped into four major regions known as the Four Symbols (Si Xiang), each associated with a direction, season, and mythical beast.
