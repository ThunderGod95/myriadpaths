# Chapter 87: A Dagger Hidden in a Smile

At the banquet table.

Only Li Qi and this bald seal were present.

Although it was an open-air banquet, no one else dared to approach. Only the two of them ate.

After several rounds of drinks, they had mostly finished their introductions.

Li Qi learned that this person's name was Bao Dun, a guest elder of the Mount Bo Sect.

As for the Mount Bo Sect, it was a Jianghu sect, one of the many sects within the martial circles of the Great Deer Kingdom. Quite a few wealthy merchants would send their children there to learn martial arts, so they carried some weight. He heard that the sect leader of the Mount Bo Sect also had some influence within the prefecture city.

However, from Bao Dun's speech, Li Qi could hear an absolute disdain for the Mount Bo Sect.

Yet, he held no such disdain for Li Qi.

The reason seemed to be because... Li Qi knew the nine-rank classification system.

After Li Qi revealed his knowledge of the nine-rank system, Bao Dun's attitude had instantly changed.

This made Li Qi understand a few more things.

It seemed... the thigh he had clung to was truly extraordinary. To these people, just the nine-rank classification system was considered a secret. The lifelong goal of the Mount Bo Sect disciples was simply to become an 'Innate Martial Artist.'

In other words, to enter Rank 9 of the Martial Dao.

The Li Prefecture Military Commander, whom he had once thought to be invincible, was nothing more than a Rank 7.

And this person was already the strongest expert in Bao Dun's understanding. Bao Dun had even proudly claimed that his cultivation method could also reach Rank 7, at which point he would become a figure akin to a deity.

He also asked Li Qi what rank his cultivation method could reach.

Naturally, Li Qi told the truth, saying that his cultivation method could reach Rank 8.

It wasn't a lie either; Carp Stream Intent could indeed reach Rank 8.

Judging from Bao Dun's account, the Mount Bo Sect's cultivation methods could reach Innate realm at best—meaning Rank 9 was their absolute limit.

And yet, a cultivation method like that could actually sustain an entire sect.

This made Li Qi sigh at the disparities in the world.

It also made him lament once more the vastness of the world and his own insignificance.

After learning that Li Qi's cultivation method could reach Rank 8, Bao Dun's attitude grew even more intimate.

Li Qi knew the reason too.

When making friends, the best kind of friend to have is one who has some ability, but is still inferior to yourself.

In short, this drinking session was just like any ordinary banquet. They talked about everything under the sun, from distant lands to local customs.

Bao Dun shared his understanding of the cultivation world, filling in many gaps in Li Qi's knowledge.

As for Li Qi, he shared some trivial tidbits of knowledge from the [Book of Invocation], such as a certain bug originating from a specific place, or the effects of different colored grasses.

But these things, which were as common as weeds in the [Book of Invocation], made Bao Dun exclaim in awe, praising Li Qi for his extensive experience and knowledge.

This drinking session could barely be considered one where both host and guest enjoyed themselves.

"Sigh, Brother Li, what is your relationship with this gang of trackers? Why did you run over here? It caused your older brother to misunderstand your situation, almost leading to a terrible mix-up," Bao Dun asked.

"Ah, I was born here. I just went out into the world to make a living and was fortunate enough to join my current sect. So I'm just returning home in glory," Li Qi said with a smile.

"So that's how it is. Then congratulations to Brother Li on leaping over the dragon gate! We'll have to look out for each other from now on," Bao Dun poured wine for Li Qi with a grinning face.

Li Qi downed his cup, and both sides erupted into laughter.

After three rounds of wine, Bao Dun bid his farewell and left.

Li Qi then started his second meal.

What second meal?

Naturally, it was the meal being prepared by the brothers of the Wave-Rowing Gang, who had returned from buying groceries.

They had seen Li Qi eating, but under Sixth Uncle's signaling gaze, they hadn't disturbed him.

As Li Qi ate on this side, he sat at the same table as Sixth Uncle.

Then, he looked at Sixth Uncle.

"Sixth Uncle, I never came back tonight. Li Qi is still out there running for his life," he said to Sixth Uncle in a low voice.

Sixth Uncle understood the stakes, so he didn't say a word, only nodding silently.

But he wasn't at ease with the others. After hastily taking a few bites of the stir-fried meat that he usually couldn't afford, he tucked his hands into his sleeves and quickly hurried out the door.

He was probably going out to spread the word and notify the other brothers.

As for Li Qi, he acted as if nothing had happened—eating, drinking, and shooting the breeze with the brothers of the Wave-Rowing Gang.

After eating, everyone was full and satisfied.

The trackers still wanted to hang out a bit longer, wanting to hear Li Qi boast and talk more about the outside world.

But Li Qi pulled a long face: "Are you guys not working tomorrow? Do you expect me to feed you for the rest of your lives?"

Only then did the trackers awkwardly scratch their heads and return to sleep, feeling slightly dejected.

They usually slept around this time anyway. Because there were no lamps at night, and because they were exhausted from a long day's work, going to sleep early was the only way they would have strength for tomorrow.

After they all went to sleep, Li Qi sat next to the racks used for drying fish.

A while later, Sixth Uncle returned. He gave Li Qi a nod, exchanged a few pleasantries, and then went back to lie down.

Seeing this, Li Qi stood up, stretched lazily, and also entered his old house.

Someone was already living here.

After all, the trackers didn't have many houses. It was impossible to leave one sitting empty for long.

Hearing someone push the door open, the person inside quickly rolled out of bed and saw Li Qi.

"Brother Li?" He rubbed his eyes, somewhat confused. "Are you sleeping here tonight? I'll give you the spot then."

As he spoke, he started to get up.

"No need, you sleep. I just came in to take a look." Li Qi told him to lie back down. Then, from inside the house, he drew his saber, quietly cut a hole in the back wall, and slipped outside.

Outside was a tributary of the Li River.

Li Qi slipped silently into the water, then placed his military saber near the hole. Following the tributary, he silently swam underwater into the main Li River.

Did he really trust Bao Dun just because they had a few drinks together?

What a joke.

During the banquet, Li Qi noticed Bao Dun casually glance at his saber at least five times. His conversation was full of probes and underlying attempts to display his own strength.

However, the other party was perhaps wary of his sect or his strength, and therefore held off from making a move for now. After all, they were inside Li Prefecture City, and making a huge scene wouldn't be good.

When lowly gangs slaughtered each other, the commotion was small, and the constables couldn't be bothered to care.

But if two Rank 9 experts fought head-on, the commotion would be massive. A constable might even step in to handle it.

Regardless of whether the other party's malicious intentions were dead or alive, Li Qi couldn't rest easy.

It would be fine for him alone, but the brothers of the Wave-Rowing Gang couldn't just pack up and move. They couldn't afford to offend the Mount Bo Sect.

Then there was only one option left... strike first to gain the upper hand.

Li Qi lurked silently, swimming right beneath the painted boat on the other side of the Li River.

This was where Bao Dun and the Mount Bo Sect disciples were staying.

He clung to the bottom of the boat.

Holding his breath and calming his mind.

He pressed his ear against the hull, listening carefully to what was being said above.

He listened for a full hour.

Li Qi was certain now.

At the very least, these disciples were unaware of the situation. Most of them were just minding their own business.

As for Bao Dun... there wasn't the slightest sound coming from him.

This made Li Qi feel extremely uneasy.
