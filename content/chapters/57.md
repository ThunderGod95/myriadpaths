# Chapter 57: Spread Across the World

"Ah, from the look in your eyes, you probably think you've stumbled upon some miraculous encounter, right? Don't even think about it. In the past, the various Daoist Traditions harbored an idea to 'spread it across the world,' hoping to pass the Dao down to the realm so that everyone could hear of the Dao and walk its path." Seeing Li Qi's expression, Shen Shuibi immediately elaborated, as if she had seen this reaction many times before.

"For everyone to hear the Dao and walk its path, to learn the path they desire and practice it themselves—this was the shared wish of the mighty figures across numerous Daoist Traditions. Once they reached a consensus, they launched this initiative," Shen Shuibi explained.

"And so~" She held up a finger, a proud expression appearing on her face. "Right now, among all of you, in every place, there are traces of cultivation methods. The fact that anyone can learn a cultivation method, that everyone has cultivation methods to strengthen their bodies and grant them various extraordinary abilities, is entirely the result of that initiative."

Reaching this point, however, she became downcast again and fed Li Qi another bite. "It is just that, in the end, the initiative still failed. It was too easy for the masses to hear the Dao; even commoners and illiterates could go listen to a Sage preach. Because of this, while the first hundred years saw the Dao spread across heaven and earth to the joy of all sentient beings, the following millennium gradually devolved into a state where no one respected the Dao anymore. Some even recklessly modified Daoist Traditions to establish themselves, eventually plunging the world into utter chaos."

"After that came the great upheaval of ten thousand Daos. Old Daoist Traditions, new Daoist Traditions, and traditions that could hardly be considered Daoist Traditions at all—it all turned into a massive catastrophe that swept across the world."

"At the final moment, the leaders of the various Daoist Traditions reached an agreement, setting the rule that 'the Dao cannot be lightly imparted, and methods cannot be casually taught.' Only then did cultivators gradually fade from the mortal realm."

"And then we arrive at the present. Basically, everywhere still bears remnants from that era, and the common folk mostly hold a few fragments in their hands, allowing them to use cultivation methods to improve their lives like this. That cultivation method of yours should be one of the fragments from back then," Shen Shuibi said. "If you don't mind, you can show it to me. I might be able to trace it back to its roots and uncover the original source of this cultivation method for you, rather than just its current fragmented state."

After listening to this, Li Qi was astonished.

He was not only amazed by the stories of the past but also immensely surprised by Shen Shuibi's proposal.

"Are you saying that my Wave-Shattering Force is very likely a Daoist Tradition fragment passed down from that 'spread across the world' initiative?" Li Qi asked.

"Not likely, but definitely. Otherwise, with so many cultivation methods in the world, could they all be self-created? There might be a few self-created ones, but ninety-nine percent of them are legacies of former Daoist Traditions. The fact that you used this to condense a sliver of inner qi proves that it might be a method of the Martial Dao, just an incomplete one. If you hand it over to me, I really might be able to trace it back to its source." When speaking of such matters, Shen Shuibi became exceptionally confident, her face brimming with pride.

She was the Lady's rabbit, after all!

Having stayed by the Lady's side for several centuries, she had read more books than she could count!

Li Qi naturally had no objections to this. The cultivation method for the Wave-Shattering Force was quite simple anyway, and there was nothing actually difficult to pronounce, so he quickly recited the incantations and training methods.

As for the taboo against leaking a cultivation method to outsiders?

That was a rule meant for ordinary people. Could Shen Shuibi really be trying to swindle his garbage cultivation method? Perhaps the Wave-Shattering Force was important to him, but Shen Shuibi was Rank 5!

Rank 5!

What kind of concept was that?

An expert—the kind of expert whose prowess knew no bounds!

If Shen Shuibi hadn't crippled her own cultivation base, he probably wouldn't have had any ties with a girl like her in his entire life.

Because of that, he felt absolutely no psychological pressure.

However, after listening to him, Shen Shuibi furrowed her brows tightly. Even her hand, which had been feeding him, came to a halt as she froze in place.

Li Qi knew that this girl possessed a single-track mind and would automatically forget everything else while she was thinking. Thus, he didn't rush her; instead, he lifted the pot himself and began to drink from it.

A pot of porridge, weighing a full ten catties, filled with various mountain goods, wild herbs, cured meat, and crushed rice cakes, seasoned with coarse salt and cooked to fragrant perfection. Li Qi disregarded the heat, slurping it down noisily until he swiftly finished the entire pot.

Li Qi drank until his stomach was perfectly round; his previously empty belly was now stuffed full. He felt a wave of absolute satisfaction as strength surged throughout his body, and the sensation of weakness gradually faded.

Yet he knew that this vitality seemed to be due to... that sliver of inner qi?

Given his injuries, he shouldn't have been this energetic, but that inner qi was currently breaking itself down to supply his body with vitality and suppress the pain.

It was even helping him ward off miasma, poison qi, cold qi, and summer qi.

It was a bit like the internal energy found in wuxia novels—expending it could provide the body with numerous extraordinary traits.

Coupled with the fact that he was full, his body was also gradually recovering. The weakness caused by forcefully squeezing out his body's Essence, Qi, and Spirit was slowly healing now that he had eaten his fill.

Sure enough, for humans, eating was still the most important and the most nourishing thing.

After having a meal, even before digesting it, Li Qi already felt his strength returning.

He stood up and checked the color of the sky.

It was morning.

There was still time.

He hurriedly offered sacrifices to the Azure Dragon of the East, dragging his ailing body against the clock to complete today's four-season ritual.

Upon receiving a wisp of Great Forest Wood qi, he used it immediately.

As immense vitality poured into him, his wound instantly began to itch, a clear sign that it was healing.

Sure enough, he felt much more at ease this way.

Having finished all of this, Li Qi lay back down.

This way, he should be fully recovered by tomorrow.

This crisis could finally be considered resolved.

Li Qi was just about to close his eyes when Shen Shuibi suddenly clapped her hands together and exclaimed happily, "I've got it! Isn't this just the Carp Stream Intent?!"

Startled, Li Qi sat up abruptly, only to aggravate his wound, which immediately forced him to lie back down.

_So painful._

Shen Shuibi, however, paid no mind to this. She rushed over, her face full of joy. "I remember now, Li Qi! This technique of yours is clearly a minor skill from the Carp Stream Intent!"

"The Carp Stream Intent is a Martial Dao cultivation method from a minor sect under the jurisdiction of my Mount Luofu. If cultivated to the later stages, it can harmonize with the True Intent of Luofu and allow one to enter the Daoist sects!" Shen Shuibi said, running up to Li Qi.

With that smug demeanor, her entire face seemed to scream, "Praise me, praise me."

"What did you say? The Wave-Shattering Force is a cultivation method from Mount Luofu?" Li Qi was stunned.

"Mhm. Although it's quite a coincidence, it truly is a Martial Dao method from beneath Mount Luofu. Do you want it? I can teach you," Shen Shuibi offered.

"Then I owe you my deepest thanks, Miss Shen," Li Qi thanked her sincerely.

"Mhm, I'll teach you later. It's not anything rare anyway; even if practiced to the end, it's just a Rank 8 art of Jianghu. But before that, do you want to see Old Ma?" Shen Shuibi asked suddenly.

"Old Ma? Isn't he grazing?" Li Qi glanced around but realized he couldn't see Old Ma anywhere.

_Huh, where did Old Ma run off to?_

"He is too embarrassed to see you, because the people this time came chasing after him," Shen Shuibi explained.

Hearing this, Li Qi waved his hand dismissively. "Sigh, I wondered what it was. Hurry up and call him back. Without him, we won't have any way to travel later."
