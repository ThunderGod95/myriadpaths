# Chapter 28: Test

"You're going to let me go?!" Shen Shuibi looked at Young Master Zhu in surprise.

"I am not letting you go; I am letting you take my messenger to find Lady Luofu. Tell her that Shaman God Mountain is willing to accept her and is willing to withstand the pressure of the Tang Empire for her."

"Is that so... But, I have another question, Grand Invocator..." Shen Shuibi considered her words. "I heard that in the beginning, didn't everyone in Baiyue wear animal skins? Why are you all wearing the cloth attire of the Tang Empire now, and the latest styles at that?"

Only this time she did not get an answer, because Young Master Zhu's expression changed. In a fit of rage, he waved his sleeve directly at her.

*Bam!* Shen Shuibi felt as if her head had been smashed by a sledgehammer!

Then, she felt her soul being forcibly stripped from her body. Everything before her eyes turned indistinct, and she fell uncontrollably downward; she lost her physical form and turned into a spirit body.

All around her was an indescribable whistling. Wooden floorboards and walls could not hinder her at all.

Then, it was as if a rope forcefully bound her and dragged her back.

Before her eyes, bizarre scenery whistled past; everything in the world seemed twisted.

Then, she saw a vision of hell.

Emerging from a purgatory of scorching thirst spanning five hundred leagues, the denizens of hell scrambled over one another amidst infernal flames that seared and pressed upon them, boiling their very flesh. Countless souls wailed in agony—a suffering beyond words.

However, these hallucinations did not last long. Soon, she was dragged back into her own body.

Her soul was still in turmoil, the experience indescribable.

Shen Shuibi clutched her chest, feeling waves of nausea.

"I have carved a mark on your divine soul that only my lineage of Shaman God Mountain knows. While this is a mark, it is also a letter; inside, it records the words I wish to say to Lady Luofu."

"This thing does not have a tracking function, so you can rest assured. After all, if I wanted to find Lady Luofu, I could just take you back, use you as a sacrifice, and have a Grand Diviner perform a divination." Young Master Zhu's complexion didn't look too good, but he still explained to Shen Shuibi with patience.

"Next, my messenger is that person." Young Master Zhu walked to the window and pointed at Li Qi down below.

Then, ignoring Shen Shuibi, his figure flickered and suddenly disappeared from where he stood.

He left the rabbit demon standing there with a blank face.

Li Qi slept soundly.

Honestly speaking, he rarely slept this well. However, having eaten until his belly was round, sleep came easily and comfortably.

Furthermore, he had stayed up for two days and one night before, and most of that time was spent running wildly on mountain roads; he was dead tired. To be able to rest properly at this time—nothing could be better.

After all, no one could run a marathon for two days and one night and not sleep soundly afterward.

However, while sleeping, he suddenly sensed someone beside him.

Li Qi rolled over and sat up in an instant!

He was still carrying nine hundred and ninety-two Great Deer Wuzhu on his body! Even when sleeping, he didn't dare to sleep like the dead.

However, as he got to his feet and looked over, he nearly stumbled and fell.

Appearing in front of him was the young scholar who had appeared at the Strong Force Gang before!

"Shh, don't shout. Shouting would disturb the peace and attract unwanted attention." Young Master Zhu placed a finger to his lips.

Li Qi was still in shock but calmed down immediately.

This young scholar could grant a divine will inheritance and bestow a spell art with a mere wave of his hand. Now he had appeared before him without a sound...

He had not a shred of ability to resist in front of this person, so there was no need to struggle at all.

Furthermore, for him to appear beside Li Qi in the middle of the night, it couldn't be out of boredom. He must want something, must have some design for him.

What could a great figure like this possibly want from a poor boat tracker?

For this kind of person, what could genuinely interest him about Li Qi... was probably the dual identity of being an owner of an Outer Dao object and being a person of the Outer Dao, right?

Thinking of this, Li Qi's hair stood on end, but he dared not move, merely standing in place awkwardly yet vigilantly.

Although he knew that vigilance was useless.

Still, the man hadn't killed or captured him on sight, which meant he was still valuable enough to talk to. To gain the upper hand in this conversation… he had to understand what the man wanted from him, or needed him to do. Then… even if he didn't dare to foolishly haggle, he might at least gain something from it.

_At the very least… I have to keep this powerful master from wanting to kill me, right?_ Li Qi thought helplessly.

"My surname is Zhu; you may call me Young Master Zhu," the young scholar introduced himself.

Li Qi immediately clasped his hands and bowed. "This lowly one greets Young Master Zhu. For Young Master Zhu to seek this lowly one out late at night, there must be an urgent matter. This lowly one will certainly agree to everything and is willing to serve Young Master Zhu, offering my meager efforts!"

"Hmph. You are a clever one. Your words are far more pleasing than that clueless woman's," Young Master Zhu chuckled, his grim expression softening slightly. "You guessed correctly. I have indeed come to entrust you with a task. But before that, there is something else I must tell you."

"Do you know that you are about to die?" Young Master Zhu clapped one hand over the other, speaking with a beaming smile.

Li Qi's heart skipped a beat, but he immediately set his mind at ease again.

Since the other party brought up that he was about to die, he estimated that there really was some unknown crisis approaching, and he might truly be in mortal danger.

But Young Master Zhu had previously admitted that he had a matter to hand over to him. By bringing up the impending death afterward, it was obvious that this big shot was prepared to take action to resolve the matter. He likely wanted Li Qi to repay this kindness by doing his utmost to complete the task he was about to entrust to him.

Li Qi immediately cooperated, bowing his head and bending his body. "Young Master! This lowly one's life is cheap and not worth pitying, but I only fear delaying the great matter Young Master wishes to entrust to me..."

Young Master Zhu nodded with satisfaction. "Though I know there is little sincerity in your words, it at least proves you are a clever man. Did you know that the initial affair with the Strong Force Gang was planned by me, and the target was the Outer Dao object and the person of the Outer Dao? Do you know why I did this?"

"Although it was sudden, the matter is of great importance. This lowly one has been anxious, pondering it day and night, and I believe I have some inkling… But your designs are too vast, Young Master. I am like an ant in a great mountain; I can glimpse the rocks and trees, but I cannot perceive the mountain's full form…" Li Qi replied respectfully, feigning hesitation.

"I believe you have the ability to see the whole from a single part. Why don't I give you a few clues, and you can deduce the matter yourself? How about it? If you cannot even do that, I will find it difficult to entrust this task to you," Young Master Zhu said.
