# Chapter 7: Him Again

As for Li Qi, although he had been attacked, he did not raise an alarm. Instead, he made his way back home in peace and quiet.

The Wave-Rowing Gang's headquarters was also located by the river, right next to the shipwrights.

Just as the Strong Force Gang had a decent relationship with the tailors, the Wave-Rowing Gang was on very good terms with the shipwrights.

The Wave-Rowing Gang often helped the shipwrights haul new boats out for free, and in return, the shipwrights would repair scrapped vessels and gift them to the gang. This mutual assistance had fostered a strong bond between the two organizations.

As the second-in-command of the Wave-Rowing Gang, Li Qi was greeted by people all along the way as he returned.

"Brother Li is back! The pigs have been slaughtered and brought back. We're cooking them right now!"

"The Boat Boss is here too, and he brought wine! I heard it was a reward from the big shots on the ship! Hurry over, Brother Li, or there won't be any left!"

The shipwrights and trackers were gathered together, grinning as they greeted Li Qi. Almost everyone held a bowl of stewed meat, slurping it down with such gusto they looked ready to swallow the bowls whole.

Of the five fat pigs, they had slaughtered one as soon as they got back. It weighed between five hundred to thousand kg. After removing the bones, the remaining offal and meat totaled over a five hundred kg. With the two groups combined numbering only three or four hundred people, there was more than enough for everyone to have one or two kg each.

To the trackers, the River Breaking day was like the New Year.

For the Strong Force Gang, who had failed to secure the River Breaking qualification, it practically meant going a whole year without meat.

However... Li Qi now knew that compared to a few pigs, what they really wanted was the Ox Strength Art, a genuine spell art.

And now, they knew that he was the one who had stolen their spell art.

But evidently, they never imagined that Li Qi had cultivated the Ox Strength Art to the stage of great accomplishment in a single night.

Never mind them, even Li Qi hadn't expected it!

However, Li Qi already had a plan in mind.

He acted as if nothing was wrong all the way back, exchanging greetings, yet he deliberately drew attention to his soaking wet appearance. He looked as if he had just emerged from the water; even his hair was drenched.

That was because he *had* just come out of the water.

Moreover, there were bloodstains on his clothes, which he had smeared there on purpose.

He walked into the crowd nonchalantly, then suddenly limped and took a tumble to the ground.

"Brother Li?!" The trackers beside him hurriedly set down their bowls and rushed over to help him up.

"I'm fine, I just slipped!" Li Qi immediately stood up on his own and pushed the others away. Then, under everyone's hesitant gazes, he quickly walked into his house and shut the door.

This left the group of trackers and shipwrights looking at each other in dismay.

"Does Brother Li seem injured?"

"I think I felt blood. And we didn't go in the water today, right? Why is he soaked through?"

"I'll go find Uncle Liu!" One tracker reacted quickly and ran off immediately.

Meanwhile, Li Qi sat on his bed and waited for a moment.

As expected, a knock soon sounded at the door, accompanied by Uncle Liu's voice asking if he was alright.

Li Qi immediately got up, opened the door, pulled Uncle Liu inside, and then slammed the door shut with a bang.

These wooden shacks didn't have windows to begin with. Once the door was closed, it was pitch black inside, so he didn't have to worry about anyone peeking.

As for Uncle Liu, he had been happily eating meat and drinking wine. But when someone suddenly said Li Qi was back and injured, he was so startled that he swallowed the meat in his mouth, downed his wine in one gulp, and rushed over in a panic.

He knew Li Qi had stolen the Strong Force Gang's spell art, so he was particularly cautious.

However, as soon as he entered, he saw that Li Qi was full of energy, showing not the slightest sign of injury.

"What is this?" Uncle Liu was a bit confused.

Li Qi confirmed the door was shut and dragged a wooden stump over to block it. Then he looked at Uncle Liu.

"Uncle Liu, don't say anything yet. Keep your voice down and listen to me."

Hearing this, Uncle Liu immediately fell silent, suppressing his confusion as he quietly waited for Li Qi's explanation.

"I was ambushed by people from the Strong Force Gang on my way back. There were two of them, armed with a wooden club and a dagger. They were trying to kill me"

"Huh?! They've already discovered you?" Uncle Liu's expression grew grave, and his voice rose.

"Shh!" Li Qi immediately held a finger to his lips.

Uncle Liu stopped talking at once and lowered his voice. "What's going on? How did they find out?"

"I'm not sure, but it's obvious they know. They even sent people specifically to ambush me. I reckon our headquarters isn't safe either, but since we're not easy targets, they don't dare start an all-out war just yet." Li Qi voiced his conjecture.

"So, that's why you're faking an injury?" Uncle Liu looked thoughtful.

"Yes. I suspect they have someone watching our place right now."

If he could sneak into the Strong Force Gang's territory, they could naturally do the same. The trackers' discipline was too poor; it was hard for them to maintain focus for long, and their work was exhausting, so they really couldn't spare the manpower to keep watch.

"Then should we go search them out right now?" Uncle Liu suggested.

"No, don't alert the enemy. I faked my injury just now for a reason. Uncle Liu, go out in a bit and quietly spread word of my condition. Make the Strong Force Gang let their guard down," Li Qi instructed.

"But... what use is that?" Uncle Liu was a bit puzzled.

It was true that feigning injury could lull the enemy into a false sense of security, but what good would that do?

"Of course it's useful... We can—strike first to gain the upper hand." Li Qi clenched his fist and punched the air viciously!

The leader of the Strong Force Gang was named Lu Shan.

The trackers of the Strong Force Gang usually called him Boss Shan, while other gangs typically called him Big Strong Shan.

True to his name, his cultivation method had endowed him with an incredibly robust physique. He could shoulder a load of one thousand kilograms and pull a small boat all by himself. Even some of the strongmen in the city couldn't match his strength.

However, those who knew him well were aware that he possessed not only a powerful body but also a sharp mind.

In previous years, he had once squeezed the Wave-Rowing Gang to the brink of collapse, but then a man named Li Qi had popped out of nowhere and pulled the Wave-Rowing Gang back from the edge.

And recently, it was this Li Qi again...

"Li Qi... Li Qi." Lu Shan rubbed his temples, then stroked his large bald head.

The men he had steeled himself to send out to intercept and kill Li Qi had not yet returned.

Just that day, he had received the divine will inheritance from that important figure. The entire Strong Force Gang had received it, yet, surprisingly, an outsider had been present as well.

That person had been masked, but his build was very familiar.

He had immediately rushed over, but failed to catch him; the man ran very fast.

Later, the Strong Force Gang found another strongman. Reportedly, the man had been bumped into by a lunatic on the road, who had torn off his mask and punched him viciously in the face.

After questioning that man carefully, Lu Shan finally confirmed it: that person was definitely Li Qi!

Li Qi again!

Dammit! It was always Li Qi!

This guy was endless trouble. If not for him, there would have been only one tracker gang in Li Prefecture City long ago!
