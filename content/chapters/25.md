# Chapter 25: Wanted

The traveling merchants breathed a sigh of relief and praised Li Qi one after another.

"Exactly. I was ready to draw my blade, but Brother Li Qi was even more impressive. I didn't expect him to actually bluff his way through!"

"I saw that the demon was mostly confused in the head. It should be the type like Old Granny Bear, acting according to a set of rules."[^1]

"Indeed, I've also heard that there are some demons who knock on your door at night. If you don't open it, they won't come in, but if you do, they will eat you. These ghosts and monsters all have strange habits. That demon is likely the same. If we had really used our weapons, we might not have made it out. Li Qi is truly sharp!"

It turned out that Li Qi, Ba Kui, and the others had realized she was a demon the moment they sensed something wrong with the woman.

What do you do if it's a demon?

The others immediately went on guard, ready to fight for their lives.

But Li Qi saw that the demon was acting strange yet remained calm, even attempting to communicate using rules and logic. Unexpectedly, they really managed to escape.

Such good luck! That demon was also one who followed rules!

This situation was not uncommon. Legends like Old Granny Bear, the Monkey Opera, the Starving Ghost, Great Immortal Huang, and the House-Guarding Snake all involved demons that mostly possessed some logic. If you didn't violate their taboos, there was actually a sliver of a chance for survival.

It was precisely because Li Qi thought of this that he forced himself to remain calm and speak with the demon.

That was a demon capable of taking human form! If she had really lashed out, Li Qi had no doubt that not a single person in their group would have survived.

As for the matter of Li Qi carrying the demon back, the group didn't mind it much.

Who knew if they would have been chased down and killed if they had just left her there?

What if leaving her to die caused the demon to demand their lives?

It was better this way. To put it nicely, one could even say they formed a good karmic tie with the demon. It was a happy ending for everyone, so they wouldn't blame Li Qi.

As mentioned before, although these merchants did not distinguish between good and evil, they still held to a small righteousness. Li Qi had gone through life and death with them, so they wouldn't turn their backs on him over a small matter.

Amidst everyone's joy, they finally arrived at the edge of the city.

Feng County was here. No matter the circumstances, they should be safe now.

Around the cities, there were the Demon Suppression Division and the Garrison Envoys. Even in the countryside, there were mostly some shamans and spirit mediums who could perform exorcisms and eliminate demons.

Therefore, the edge of the city was definitely safe. If even the city outskirts weren't safe...

Then they might as well wait for death. What level of existence would a demon have to be to breach a county seat?

Once everyone had finally relaxed, Li Qi prepared to part ways with them.

They had only met by chance and traveled together for one night. Each had their own business to attend to; they couldn't stay together forever.

"Big Brother Li, I will take my leave first. The place I'm going to is far, and my matters are heavy, so I will bid farewell now." Ah Du was the first to say goodbye.

This was quite normal. He was someone who had chosen to travel alone in the vast winter; it was natural that he carried some heavy burden. The group didn't detain him, and after saying goodbye, he left.

Then it was the merchants. They all carried baskets on their backs filled with goods that needed to be peddled or had long been ordered. They needed to deliver them and each had their own work to busy themselves with.

Ba Kui, however, said to Li Qi, "We will set off at noon tomorrow for Lianxia. The drink I promised you won't happen tonight, but tomorrow morning, let's meet here again. I'll definitely let you drink your fill!"

Lianxia was a section of the gorge where the Li River flowed and was a gathering place for many ships. It was only natural for merchants to go there.

Li Qi naturally had no objections. Getting a free meal and making some friends was a good thing. He readily agreed and parted ways with the merchants.

Just as everyone had become familiar on the road, they were separated in the blink of an eye.

Aside from Ba Kui, no one else had said what they were actually going to do. Everyone had their own affairs, and there was no need to reveal all their secrets.

Worldly affairs were mostly like this; those who passed by were always more numerous than those who gathered.

After parting with the group, Li Qi walked alone near the city gate, temporarily not entering the city.

Mainly, he saw a notice board not far away, to the side of the city gate. Someone was currently posting a notice, and many people were gathering around, so he prepared to go over and take a look.

Walking over and looking at the notice board, there was indeed a newly posted notice.

This notice stated that a group of merchants, twelve in total, had encountered a demon on the road and all had died. The notice was posted in hopes that relatives and friends would come to claim the bodies.

Li Qi's hair stood on end.

Could it be... the people Ba Kui encountered were actually ghosts!?

However, before he could succeed in scaring himself, his confusion was resolved because portraits were hung below.

Taking a closer look, they had absolutely no relation to Ba Kui and his group; it was purely another band of unlucky souls.

Only then did he set his mind at ease and read carefully.

It was just that, the more he looked, and the more he studied the portraits, the more familiar those people seemed.

After thinking carefully, he finally remembered. Weren't these the people hanging there the same ones from one of the two merchant groups he had encountered at the roadside tea stall?

Ba Kui's group had successfully escaped, but this group had all died on the road. After being discovered by travelers, the magistrate was informed!

After clarifying the matter, Li Qi shook his head.

He once again recognized the danger of traveling alone.

No wonder everyone was unwilling to travel far, and viewed traveling alone as akin to facing tigers and leopards, fearing it for their lives.

However, continuing to look down, Li Qi saw a wanted poster.

It read:

<div class="special-announcement">

Writ of Arrest, by Order of the Governor of Li Prefecture!

Now, the Tang Empire rebel, Lady Luofu, being a Demon God, received the Emperor's grace to shepherd the people of a region. Yet she lacked virtue and conduct, bringing chaos to the commoners and employing villains, causing great disorder in the region.

The Censor of Jiannan Dao ordered her to investigate herself, yet she did not respect the Sovereign's command. Arrogant and rebellious, she acted against authority. The Emperor was lenient and issued a decree ordering her to close her doors and reflect on her faults. However, this scoundrel disregarded the Sovereign's command, openly insulted the Sovereign and deceived her superiors, refused to obey transfers, and intended to defect to Tianzhu.

Committing such a great crime, she deserves execution. But Lady Luofu possesses profound dharma power and extraordinary divine abilities. She attacked and killed the Imperial Envoys and fled the country in treason. She has now escaped into Baiyue, whereabouts unknown. Our Great Deer Kingdom is one of the Baiyue nations, having been friendly with the Tang Empire for generations and bound as brothers. A rebel of the brother nation shall be a rebel of our Great Deer Kingdom. Anyone with clues regarding Lady Luofu shall be rewarded with one hundred gold. Anyone who can kill her shall be conferred a second-rank peerage and a fiefdom of ten thousand households. Anyone who can capture her alive shall be granted a territory of one prefecture and titled King.

This wanted poster was different from the others; it was written on yellow cloth. It had likely been hanging by the city wall for some time, yet it remained in the front row, obviously being a very important item.

"A wanted poster for treason... that makes sense." Li Qi scanned it once and skipped right over it.

What did it have to do with him? That level of fierce man—oh, no, fierce person—and they're talking about killing her?

The effect of this notice was mostly to warn the world that such a rebel existed.

That was all. How could it be possible for civilian forces to kill her?

Skipping over this, Li Qi continued to look down.

Then he saw himself.

[^1]: **Old Granny Bear (熊嘎婆 - Xióng Gā Pó):** A famous figure in Sichuan folklore, essentially the Chinese version of the "Little Red Riding Hood" wolf. It is a bear spirit that disguises itself as a grandmother to eat children. The author references it here because in these stories, the children often survive by outsmarting the monster using specific logic or "rules" rather than fighting it directly.
