# Chapter 40: On the Road

The mountains were high and the rivers long; the green trees were lush and verdant.

Li Qi carried a large wicker basket on his back, heartache filling him as he weighed his money pouch.

Nine hundred and ninety-two coins, and now only two hundred and thirty-one remained.

In exchange, he had acquired the large basket on his back.

There were many things inside.

The basket itself was not cheap.

There was oiled paper for rain protection, rice cakes that stored well, and some salted dried meat.

There was a large canvas sheet; in the wild, it could be folded into a large bundle to hold things, rolled up into a handy short rope, used as a blanket, and it was also wear-resistant and fireproof.

Two wood chopping knives and a small whetstone; if something happened in the wild, he at least had some sharp weapons, which could also be used to cut vines blocking the way or chop wood for fire.

Some fire sticks and two flints; needless to say, these were for making fire. He used the flint normally, but in a critical moment, he could use the fire sticks that ignited with a single shake.

There was also Golden Trauma medicine, insect repellent, some essential drugs, and necessities for wilderness survival.

A bolt of hemp cloth, some small knives, a spatula, iron heads for farm tools, and the like; he brought these to act as a traveling merchant, so when he reached certain villages, he could sell some to recover his funds.

He was poor, so earning a little bit helped.

Aside from these, there were many small odds and ends that didn't need to be mentioned one by one.

In short, Li Qi had made ample preparations to cope with the long journey ahead.

Moreover, he had spent a huge sum, a full sixty coins, to buy Shen Shuibi a change of clothes.

Her previous outfit, with its gauze scarf and openwork white robes, matched the style of Young Master Zhu, but walking alongside him, she looked like a fool waiting to be robbed.

So, he changed her into hemp clothes worn by women; now, she just looked like a pretty village girl.

Although, she was a bit *too* pretty; where would normal villagers raise such a beauty?

After all, in ordinary villages or among gang members like Li Qi, the female members of the family, even if born naturally beautiful, mostly needed to labor and manage the household.

No matter how good one's natural appearance was, if they chopped wood, pounded rice, and cooked every day from childhood, any natural beauty would grow up to look like a peasant woman—burly, thick-waisted, with rough skin, not very good-looking at all.

But to be honest, people of Li Qi's class actually needed that kind of wife.

Because they were familiar with all kinds of chores, worked quickly, were physically strong, did not get sick easily, and could work in the fields or help their husbands with heavy physical labor; they were good hands at maintaining the family livelihood, and one needed such a wife to get by.

If one really raised a delicate beauty with tender skin, a petite figure, and spoiled habits at home, even if she didn't cause trouble, the simple fact that she couldn't work would make the family burden unbearable.

They couldn't afford to raise her.

If she was willing to share the burden with her husband, then after working for two years at most, she would become just like the other peasant women, her beauty gone, becoming burly and thick-waisted.

Therefore, even though Shen Shuibi wore a set of hemp clothes, one could still tell at a glance that she was definitely not an ordinary person.

But none of that mattered anymore; after all, Li Qi felt that he couldn't be counted as an ordinary person right now either, so he should be able to handle it, as long as they weren't too conspicuous.

Walking on the road, Li Qi looked at Shen Shuibi beside him, who was traveling light without any luggage, carefree and leading the way as if on an outing.

This reminded him of the conversation when they set off.

At that time, Li Qi asked, "Miss Shen, how are you determining the direction? Where is Lady Luofu?"

"By feeling~. I've been by Her Ladyship's side since I was little. Wherever Her Ladyship is, I know it as soon as I open my eyes. As long as we follow the feeling, we can definitely find her!" Shen Shuibi said solemnly, clenching her small fist with confidence.

Honestly, Li Qi just felt it was very unreliable.

But there was no helping it; this was a world of monsters and gods, so it might actually work.

So... a journey with neither a known destination nor a planned itinerary began just like that.

The two walked all the way; Li Qi carried the large basket containing all their luggage, while Shen Shuibi carried nothing, wearing her new clothes, empty-handed, just walking forward like that.

Li Qi had questioned her approach at the very beginning.

But after walking for two days, Li Qi discovered that she really didn't seem to need luggage.

Shen Shuibi could actually remain unstained by dust; even walking in the wild, she didn't get dirty at all. She didn't sweat, nor did she have any odor. Even if she fell and got covered in dirt, when she climbed up with a bitter face, the dust would naturally slide off her body and wouldn't stick to her skin at all.

Besides that, she didn't even need to eat!

Yes, according to her, she was a natural alien species, not an ordinary demon who had achieved sentience, so she didn't need to eat ordinary food; she only needed to dine on wind and drink dew, absorbing different types of qi.

Precisely because of this, she didn't need to excrete or sweat. If she wanted, she didn't even need to breathe, though breathing was just a means of feeding for her.

No need to bathe, no sweating, forever clean, forever beautiful.

What the hell is this... a two-dimensional beauty?

Is it this convenient?

In short, taking this thing on the road meant there was absolutely no logistical pressure; she could walk on her own and ran quite fast.

Pretty good, pretty good.

The two people trekked through the desolate mountains and wild ridges for three days.

On this day, around noon, Li Qi needed to rest, make some lunch, replenish his stamina, and rest his feet.

Shen Shuibi understood very well that not everyone could be like her—smelling sweet and staying energetic without eating or bathing—so she waited patiently on the side.

After three days of interacting, the two were no longer so estranged, but Shen Shuibi usually didn't have much to say. Topics were basically initiated by Li Qi to relieve boredom on the road, so now that Li Qi went to fetch water and cook, she stayed silent and looked into the distance.

She didn't lie to Li Qi; she really didn't know where Her Ladyship was, but the little rabbit could indeed vaguely perceive Her Ladyship's location.

It was just... they had walked for three days, yet she didn't feel the distance had closed by much.

This meant that the distance walked in these three days actually counted for nothing compared to the distance to Her Ladyship.

She didn't tell Li Qi this because she was afraid that if she said it, Li Qi wouldn't want to go find Her Ladyship with her.

Because walking mountain roads was very hard for him, unlike for herself.

They had walked over two hundred *li* in these three days, but if they wanted to find Her Ladyship, they would probably have to walk tens of thousands of *li*.

If Her Ladyship didn't shift her position, they might have to walk for a year or a half.

"Sigh..." She sighed; at this speed, they would have to walk for a long time.

If only there were a horse.

Unfortunately, Li Qi was very poor and couldn't afford one. A horse cost twenty or thirty gold; although Shen Shuibi didn't think that was very expensive, Li Qi definitely couldn't take that much out.

While she was thinking this, she suddenly stood up.

Up ahead... was that the neighing of a horse?
