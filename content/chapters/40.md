# Chapter 40: On the Road

The mountains were high and the rivers long; the trees were lush and verdant.

Li Qi adjusted the large wicker basket on his back, his heart aching as he weighed his money pouch.

Nine hundred and ninety-two coins. Now, only two hundred and thirty-one remained.

In exchange, he had acquired the contents of the basket.

The basket itself hadn't been cheap, and it was packed full.

There was oiled paper for rain protection, rice cakes that stored well, and some salted dried meat.

There was a large canvas sheet. In the wild, it could be folded into a bundle to hold things, rolled into a handy short rope, or used as a blanket. It was also durable and fire-resistant.

Two wood-chopping knives and a small whetstone. If something happened in the wild, he at least had some sharp weapons, which could also be used to clear vines blocking the path or chop wood for a fire.

Some fire sticks and two flints. Needless to say, these were for making fire. He would use the flint normally, but in a critical moment, he could use the fire sticks, which ignited with a single shake.

There was also healing salve, insect repellent, some essential drugs, and other wilderness survival necessities.

A bolt of hemp cloth, some small knives, a spatula, iron heads for farm tools, and the like. He brought these to act as a traveling merchant; when he reached certain villages, he could sell them to recover some funds.

He was poor, so earning a little bit back helped.

Aside from these, there were many small odds and ends that didn't need to be mentioned one by one.

In short, Li Qi had made ample preparations to cope with the long journey ahead.

Moreover, he had spent a huge sum—a full sixty coins—to buy Shen Shuibi a change of clothes.

Her previous outfit, with its gauze scarf and openwork white robes, matched Young Master Zhu’s style perfectly, but walking alongside Li Qi, she looked like a fat sheep waiting to be slaughtered.

So, he changed her into the hemp clothes worn by common women; now, she just looked like a pretty village girl.

Although, she was a bit *too* pretty; where would a normal village raise such a beauty?

After all, for women in ordinary rural families or from the households of gang members like Li Qi, even if they were born with natural beauty, they were still expected to labor and manage the household.

No matter how good one's natural appearance was, if they chopped wood, pounded rice, and cooked every day from childhood, any natural beauty would grow up to look like a peasant woman—sturdy, thick-waisted, with rough skin. Not exactly a delicate sight.

But in truth, men of Li Qi's station needed precisely this kind of wife.

Because they were familiar with all kinds of chores, worked quickly, were physically strong, and did not get sick easily. They could work in the fields or help their husbands with heavy physical labor; they were good hands at maintaining the family livelihood, and one needed such a wife just to survive.

If a man truly kept a delicate beauty with smooth skin, a petite figure, and pampered habits at home, even if she caused no trouble, the simple fact that she could not work would be an unbearable burden on the family.

A man couldn't afford to keep her.

If she was willing to share the burden with her husband, then after working for two years at most, she would become just like the other peasant women: her beauty faded, her waist thickened.

Therefore, even though Shen Shuibi wore a set of hemp clothes, one could still tell at a glance that she was definitely not an ordinary person.

But none of that mattered anymore. Li Qi felt that he couldn't be counted as an ordinary person right now either, so he should be able to handle it, as long as they weren't too conspicuous.

Walking on the road, Li Qi looked at Shen Shuibi beside him. She was traveling light without any luggage, carefree and leading the way as if on a field trip.

This reminded him of the conversation when they set off.

At that time, Li Qi had asked, "Miss Shen, how are you determining the direction? Where is Lady Luofu?"

"By feeling~. I've been by Her Ladyship's side since I was little. Wherever Her Ladyship is, I know it as soon as I open my eyes. As long as we follow the feeling, we can definitely find her!" Shen Shuibi had declared, confidently clenching her small fists.

Honestly, Li Qi felt it was very unreliable.

But there was no helping it; this was a world of monsters and spirits, so it might actually work.

So... a journey with neither a known destination nor a planned itinerary began just like that.

The two walked all the way; Li Qi carried the large basket containing all their luggage, while Shen Shuibi carried nothing. Wearing her new clothes, empty-handed, she just walked forward.

Li Qi had questioned her approach at the very beginning.

But after walking for two days, Li Qi discovered that she really didn't seem to need luggage.

Shen Shuibi somehow remained utterly spotless. Even while trekking through the wilderness, she never got dirty, never broke a sweat, and had no body odor. Even when she stumbled and fell face-first into the dirt, as she climbed back up with a pained expression, the dust would simply slide off her, never clinging to her skin.

On top of that, she didn't need to eat!

That's right. According to her, she was a unique, naturally-born being, not some ordinary demon that had gained sentience. Thus, she did not need to consume normal food; she sustained herself by 'dining on the wind and drinking the dew,' absorbing various types of qi.

Precisely because of this, she didn't need to excrete or sweat. If she wanted, she didn't even need to breathe, though breathing was just a means of feeding for her.

No need to bathe, no sweating, forever clean, forever beautiful.

*What the hell is this... a 2D beauty?*

*Is it this convenient?*

In short, bringing her along meant there was absolutely no logistical pressure; she could walk on her own and ran quite fast.

Very good, very good indeed.

The two trekked through the desolate mountains and wild ridges for three days.

On this day, around noon, Li Qi needed to stop to make lunch, replenish his stamina, and rest his feet.

Shen Shuibi understood very well that not everyone could be like her—smelling sweet and staying energetic without eating or bathing—so she waited patiently on the side.

After three days of interacting, the two were no longer so estranged, but Shen Shuibi usually didn't have much to say. Topics were basically initiated by Li Qi to relieve boredom on the road, so now that Li Qi went to fetch water and cook, she stayed silent and looked into the distance.

She didn't lie to Li Qi; she really didn't know where Her Ladyship was, but the little rabbit could indeed vaguely perceive Her Ladyship's location.

It was just... they had walked for three days, yet she didn't feel the distance had closed by much.

This meant that the distance walked in these three days was a drop in the bucket compared to the total distance to Her Ladyship.

She didn't tell Li Qi this because she was afraid that if she said it, Li Qi wouldn't want to go find Her Ladyship with her.

Because walking mountain roads was very hard for him, unlike for herself.

They had walked over two hundred *li* in these three days, but if they wanted to find Her Ladyship, they would probably have to walk tens of thousands of *li*.

If Her Ladyship didn't shift her position, they might have to walk for a year or a half.

"Sigh..." She sighed. At this speed, they would have to walk for a long time.

If only there were a horse.

Unfortunately, Li Qi was very poor and couldn't afford one. A horse cost twenty or thirty gold. Although Shen Shuibi didn't think that was very expensive, Li Qi definitely couldn't take that much out.

While she was thinking this, she suddenly stood up.

Up ahead... was that the neighing of a horse?
