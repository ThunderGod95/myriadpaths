# Chapter 43: Mutual Aid

Aside from the baleful qi, there was also a gray, hazy qi on his body that looked very desolate.

"Baleful qi, death qi... no wonder he's hurt so badly..." Shen Shuibi's expression was no longer happy; instead, it became quite grave.

The old horse finally ran over to them.

However, before he could even come to a steady stop, his legs went soft and he fell directly to the ground, letting out a weak cry.

Shen Shuibi immediately jumped down from Li Qi's neck, walked quickly to the old horse's side, and stroked his mane and neck.

Fortunately, her body was unsullied by dust. Even though the old horse was filthy, covered in dirt and clotted blood, she wouldn't be tainted by those things.

Gravel and dust naturally slid off her, leaving no trace. It was as if she had a hydrophobic layer; nothing could adhere to her clothes or skin. Even sticky mud and blood clots slid right off.

She could walk in the rain without getting wet and through a mud pit without getting dirty. No filth could come near her.

Even more miraculously, after she stroked them, the old horse's mane—which had been severely knotted to the point Li Qi thought it would need to be cut off—actually combed out naturally.

It seemed that for Shen Shuibi to serve as a handmaiden to Lady Luofu, she must not have been a simple existence before her cultivation was ruined. She was surely a great expert.

Maybe a Rank 5 or Rank 6 master of a region?

_Considering that, for her to warm up to me so quickly without a hint of discrimination really shows her gentle nature._

_Although she really is a bit dim. I wonder if she damaged her brain when she crippled her own cultivation._

"Li Qi, go bring the luggage over. I'll check his wounds first," Shen Shuibi said to Li Qi.

Then, she lowered her head and began to clean the filth off the old horse.

She didn't even need water; where her hand passed, the filth naturally fell off and dropped to the ground.

Seeming to feel this wasn't quite right, she patted the horse and whispered something to him.

The old horse let out a whinny, propped himself up with difficulty, and struggled to his feet.

After standing up, the old horse first walked to Li Qi's side and let out a neigh, seemingly greeting him.

Hearing the weak and listless whinny, Li Qi shook his head. "There's a small river in the gorge below. You two should go wash there. You can rinse the blood and clean the wounds. I'll go get the luggage; there's medicine inside."

The old horse neighed. For some reason, although Li Qi couldn't understand it, he could feel it was a sound of gratitude.

"No need to thank me. Mutual aid, mutual aid." Li Qi waved his hand, then turned to leave.

He went back to get the luggage.

By the time he rushed back, the soup was lukewarm, and the rice cakes inside were soaked out of shape.

Well, forget it.

He added some brown coarse salt, slurped it down, and finished lunch half-eating, half-drinking.

In this desolate wilderness, with no one passing by, the hidden luggage was still there.

Shouldering the luggage, he returned again.

This time he didn't use the Great Forest Wood qi. He only had three wisps left, so he had to use them sparingly.

Without the help of the Great Forest Wood qi, his return speed was much slower.

It took about a full hour before he finally rushed back.

Carrying a basket while rushing was exhausting. He panted heavily, wiped the sweat from his forehead, and looked down from the cliff.

Down at the small river, Shen Shuibi had already cleaned the old horse quite thoroughly.

This old horse looked much better. The filth on his body had been removed completely, and the wounds had been rinsed clean with clear water. The previous wretchedness was swept away. Although he was still weak, the impression he gave shifted from an old prisoner to a sickly, dignified elder.

Truly dignified. Although this horse looked very emaciated with significantly atrophied muscles, his skeletal frame was broad. Standing up, he was still over eight _chi_ tall—that is, over two meters—much taller than Li Qi.[^1]

A mane of hair, though flecked with gray, was unusually dashing, flowing with incomparable grace when he moved.

A pair of large eyes, bright and piercing, shone with wisdom and humanity, even giving the feeling that they could speak.

Looking at this aged dragon colt, Li Qi had to admit.

He was so handsome.

Handsomer than himself.

Li Qi suddenly realized a horse was handsomer than him and felt somewhat indignant, but he immediately tossed those emotions to the back of his mind.

Why bicker with a horse!

"Li Qi! You're back? I've cleaned the wounds pretty much, just waiting for you to bring the medicine!"

"Also, I've agreed with him. We help him heal, and he'll carry us on our journey!" Shen Shuibi rushed happily in front of Li Qi and said with a grin, "This is great. The journey that would have taken a year or so will now probably only take half a month!"

"Good thing, good thing." Li Qi also smiled.

Even though this old horse was in this state, he could probably still travel eight hundred _li_ a day. As long as they took good care of him—ran a bit less in the first few days and nursed him well first—once his injuries healed, they wouldn't have to rely on their own trekking for such a long distance.

"Old Ma—let's call you that from now on[^2]. I don't know your name anyway. Come over here, I'll apply the medicine! We have a deal, don't run off after taking the medicine!" Li Qi took the healing salve out of the back basket and shouted to the old horse.

The horse seemed to truly understand human speech. He walked over, snorted at Li Qi, then obediently turned his body, presenting his wounds to Li Qi.

"He's saying thank you," Shen Shuibi said.

"No need for thanks," Li Qi replied casually, then began to apply medicine to the horse.

However, the old horse seemed very affectionate toward Li Qi, turning his head to nuzzle Li Qi from time to time.

Li Qi felt his hair stand on end.

This was a stallion.

_Damn, horses are huge._

_Scary._

But Old Ma didn't stop. Instead, he let out whinnies from time to time, as if speaking.

Li Qi couldn't understand.

But Shen Shuibi could.

"He says he wants to borrow a wisp of Azure Dragon divine qi from you," Shen Shuibi translated for Li Qi at this moment.

"A wisp of Azure Dragon divine qi? So he really came for this?" Li Qi scratched his head.

Shen Shuibi had told him before that the horse ran over voluntarily for this very purpose.

The horse nuzzled Li Qi with his nose, whinnying in his ear.

Li Qi felt a chill and took a step back.

"He says, mutual aid. You saved his life, he will repay you," Shen Shuibi continued translating.

"Repay me? How could he repay me besides carrying me for a leg of the journey?" Li Qi said.

However, he still waved his hand. "Forget it, it's also so we can get on the road faster. Never mind the repayment, just run a bit faster when we travel."

Anyway, as long as it was spring, he could obtain a fixed wisp of Azure Dragon divine qi every day. If he didn't use it when he should, it would be no different from not having it.
