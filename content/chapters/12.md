# Chapter 12: Origin

In the dark night, two burly men exchanged blows with *thwack-thwack* sounds. It seemed intense, but Lu Shan felt only obstruction in his fists and legs, as if every move and form was within the enemy's expectations.

Li Qi seemed capable of foresight, always able to intercept his moves midway, preventing him from fully executing his power!

Martial arts yielded no results, his strength couldn't compare, and he couldn't even break the opponent's skin. Faced with such disadvantages, Lu Shan was soon defeated. Li Qi broke his arms and stomped his ankles to pieces.

All around, aside from Li Qi and Lu Shan, not a single person remained.

"Phew..." Li Qi wiped a mixture of blood and sweat from his head, feeling only a bit nauseous.

It wasn't because of the killing. He had no feelings about killing; he felt neither excitement nor particular disgust. However, to appear ferocious and scare off those trackers, he had taken several bites of raw meat. The mouthful of metallic taste made him a bit sick.

In addition, he had taken several hard hits. Even with the thick hide of the Ox Strength Art, his internal organs were shaken, and his skin had split. The injuries weren't exactly critical, but they certainly weren't light.

If those twenty-something trackers had been willing to risk their lives to surround and attack him in formation, he might really have fallen here.

Fortunately, even after a certain degree of training, a rabble was still a rabble in the end.

"Big Strong Shan, you've really fallen hard this time. Well, do you yield?" Li Qi sat down, maintaining the Ox Strength Art, and spoke to Lu Shan.

"Ptui!" Lu Shan spat. But because the pain in his limbs was unbearable, the spit was weak and didn't even fly half a meter, landing on his own stomach.

"Li Qi, you knave, you are cunning! It is absolutely impossible for me to yield!" he cursed loudly.

"However, a loss is a loss, and I accept it. But you killed so many people yet left me alive only to break my limbs. I tell you, if you want to humiliate me, keep dreaming!" He struggled, shouting at Li Qi.

"Alright, I'm not sick in the head. Why would I want to humiliate you?" Li Qi shook his head. What point was there in humiliating Lu Shan?

He kept him alive simply because he had a few questions.

"You're already crippled. Answer a few of my questions, and I'll let you go back. You won't die here. You've been a gang leader for so long, you should have some savings. Go back and heal your injuries. Although you'll be a cripple and can't lift your hands, you won't starve to death. How about it? Will you do it?" Li Qi spoke straightforwardly.

"You and I both know that although we've fought for so long, we are both considered men of our word. I wouldn't deceive you at this point. How about it? Are you willing?" Li Qi sat beside him and spoke.

"What do you want to ask?" Hearing this, although Lu Shan didn't drop his guard, his tight-lipped attitude loosened somewhat.

"You definitely aren't a tracker. Where are you from?" Li Qi asked the first question.

"Tch, listen to you. Are *you* a tracker?" Lu Shan sneered, struggling to shift his body until his back rested against a stone. "Pot calling the kettle black. Three years ago, you suddenly appeared wearing strange clothes, completely powerless to truss a chicken, without a trace of a cultivation method. Were your Three Innate Treasures[^1] shattered by someone before you were thrown into Li Prefecture?"

Hearing this inexplicable term, Li Qi's expression suddenly turned grave.

He knew he had gambled correctly.

However, now was not the time to show weakness, so Li Qi shook his head. "Why ask so much about my affairs? Right now, I am asking you."

"Heh." Lu Shan laughed coldly but did not ask further questions on his own initiative.

"You haven't answered me yet. Where are you from?" Li Qi pressed.

"Song Kingdom. A deserter." Lu Shan gave the answer impatiently. "At the time, the Song Kingdom was attacked by the Tang Kingdom. The entire nation fell to ruin; generals dared not fight, and soldiers dared not advance. So I fled, following the Li River all the way to Li Prefecture."

Li Qi suddenly understood.

So that was it; everything was clear now.

The military style and the battle formation that relied on morale earlier—Lu Shan must have learned them in the army.

But thinking about it this way, something seemed off?

"Wait. If you are a deserter from the Song Kingdom, with your level of skill, how could those two tracker gangs compete with you? Shouldn't they have been swallowed up long ago? With your battle formation today, plus your martial arts, shouldn't you have won easily?" Li Qi frowned.

"You think I didn't want to? If not for you, the Wave-Rowing Gang and the Water Horse Gang would have been swallowed by me long ago!" Lu Shan glared. "The Strong Force Gang is the youngest gang. I fled here six years ago, all alone. I built the Strong Force Gang with my own two hands. My cultivation method is a strength-training method from the grassroots army of the Song Kingdom. Practicing it is equivalent to training in battle formation methods. I held back for four years and finally achieved some results, but then you popped up, forcing me to continue accumulating strength."

Lu Shan got angrier as he spoke. "If not for you, I would have been the one calling the shots here two years ago!"

Li Qi listened and thought about it carefully.

It was true!

When he first arrived here, the Strong Force Gang frequently encroached upon the other two gangs. It was just that back then, to protect himself, he devised a strategy of vertical and horizontal alliances. He united with the Water Horse Gang to resist several crushing assaults and used the terrain—relying on the Wave-Rowing Gang's advantage in the water due to their cultivation method—to hold off the Strong Force Gang several times.

Thinking back, after that, Lu Shan must have known he couldn't easily take them down as things stood, so he hid the formation, preparing to use it as a killing blow?

So, when he was finally able to obtain a spell art, he didn't hesitate to launch his plan.

He just hadn't expected that Li Qi would learn the Ox Strength Art in a single day and swiftly plan a counterattack.

Thinking about it this way... Lu Shan was a bit unlucky.

However, if he hadn't been unlucky... then the unlucky one would have been Li Qi.

"Then your formation—" Li Qi tried to speak again.

"Keep dreaming! Even if I am killed by you right here, I will absolutely not teach it to you!" Lu Shan cursed loudly, his reaction intense.

It made sense. In this world, things like cultivation methods were not passed on even in death. Unless one joined an organization and showed loyalty, established a master-disciple relationship, or made an equal exchange, getting one's hands on another's cultivation method was harder than ascending to heaven.

Just look at the Water Horse Gang and the Wave-Rowing Gang. They were nearly driven to death, yet the two sides never exchanged cultivation methods.

To them, they would probably rather be wiped out than let their secrets be spread to outsiders.

"Sigh, alright then. Anyway, you're already crippled. After today, the Strong Force Gang's morale will likely be completely scattered. You look out for yourself.".

Then, he stood up and crushed Lu Shan's head with one stomp.

Leave him a path to life?

What a joke. One look at this man revealed his wild ambition; he couldn't be trusted even if crippled! If Li Qi really let him go, what if he came back for revenge later!?

Li Qi valued integrity in most situations, but that didn't mean he would pay the price of his own life for it.

Having eliminated the future trouble, it was better to go back and think about how to deal with the government authorities.

In xianxia, these form the foundation of life and cultivation. To have them "shattered" implies one’s root potential has been destroyed, rendering them a crippled mortal unable to cultivate.
