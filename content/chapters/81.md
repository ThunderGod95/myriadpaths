# Chapter 81: Return

Returning to Li Prefecture.

Li Qi walked with a confident swagger, not looking the least bit like a wanted criminal.

Because truly, no one cared.

Half a month had passed. Only a few members of a lowly gang had died. Such incidents might not happen every day, but they were far from rare.

Moreover, when Li Qi took a look, there were around seventy or eighty wanted posters similar to his own.

This was the reality of the bottom rungs of society. Everyone had nothing but their worthless lives. When it was time to put everything on the line, the wealthy risked their fortunes and possessions.

But the wretched folk at the bottom had nothing to lose but their lives. Thus, they could only toss their sole, meager asset onto the gambling table, hoping to turn their luck around.

The ridiculous part was that, despite the rows of wanted posters, Li Qi was certain the government office of Li Prefecture City hadn't actually opened official cases for any of these people.

Opening a case meant it had to be resolved and investigated to the end.

But if no case was opened, there was absolutely no need to bother with it.

Crucially, whether a case was filed or not depended entirely on the mood of the government officials.

Meeting a responsible head constable might change things, but when laziness was an option, how long could even a responsible head constable persist?

Those who took charge of opening cases bore heavier responsibilities without any extra reward, and instead faced harsher criticism and demands. Over time, who could endure that?

Fortunately, the constables possessed absolute suppressive power. The scum at the bottom could fight all they wanted, but they all understood one rule: no matter how many died, they had to keep it contained.

If things spiraled out of control, could a bunch of thugs practicing trash cultivation methods ever defeat the constables?

If that happened, they would truly all be killed.

The area where the Wave-Rowing Gang resided was filthy, foul-smelling, and cramped. It was not a pleasant place, and aside from the lower-class residents themselves, nobody else ever wanted to go there.

Li Prefecture appeared to be a place where millions of people were packed together in a tight mass. In reality, the internal divisions were stark. Invisible, towering walls stood between the layers of society, isolating different groups of people from one another.

Walking through the streets, Li Qi scrutinized the city with the eyes of an outsider.

"It's rotten to the core," Li Qi shook his head.

Unlike those small county towns, the moment one entered Li Prefecture, a stench of decay permeated the air.

Li Qi was currently wandering around the market.

Right by his feet lay two corpses.

They appeared to be beggars who had frozen and starved to death—a mother and son. The mother was barely clothed, while the child was clad in meager rags. They had likely been thrown out onto the street to die.

And right beside those corpses, two swift horses galloped past.

Two youths dressed in fine brocade rode atop the swift horses, laughing uproariously. They nearly crashed into Li Qi, but they paid him no mind, spurring their mounts onward, fully engrossed in the thrill of their race.

Despite having lived in Li Prefecture for over two or three years, this scene still made Li Qi sigh.

In the past, he spent every day pulling boats, leaving early and returning late, exhausting himself to the bone. He had never realized that there were so many wealthy people with horses in Li Prefecture.

Sure enough, the view changes depending on where one stands.

He reckoned his previous assumption—that this world had no animal husbandry—was merely his own ignorance.

It was just that the miserable wretches at the bottom never had the right to see it, not that it didn't exist.

This place was a world away from the slums Li Qi used to live in.

Having never been here before, it was only today that he realized the sheer magnitude of the divide. Normally, coming to this area would invite scornful glares, and patrolling guards would just chase you away.

Only now, wearing these somewhat less shabby clothes, could he walk here naturally without being pointed at.

He was walking down this street for no other reason than to buy a few small gifts.

It was just that he had never witnessed many of these scenes before.

Li Qi bought quite a few things, stuffing his woven basket full. There were gifts for his brothers, as well as things for Shen Shuibi and Old Ma. However, he spent less than a thousand coins—not even enough to cover the cost of his current outfit.

Still, they were all practical items: sewing kits, durable coarse cloth, and some wooden toys. Most importantly, he bought medicines—some for bruises and injuries, others for reducing inflammation and relieving pain. These were remedies the boat trackers constantly needed.

He didn't buy any food. There was no need; food could always be bought later. It was better to buy practical things. Gifts, after all, should be useful.

With his purchases complete, Li Qi slung his basket onto his back and stepped into the familiar alleyways of his past.

He walked all the way to his old home, finding hardly anyone around. Most of the men had gone out to pull boats.

The people at the bottom toiled day and night, barely getting a few hours of rest. Those who stayed home during the day were mostly injured or sick. Sometimes, even the sick had to force themselves to work, or else their families would have no rice for the pot.

But wasn't that exactly why gangs existed?

With a gang, if something happened, your brothers could cover for you. You didn't have to shoulder everything alone.

The unity and cohesion of a gang stemmed from this very fact.

Therefore, if someone fell ill, the other brothers would share a portion of their earnings to help them scrape by and recover properly.

By the time Li Qi arrived, a few sick or injured trackers were at home tending to the salted pork made during the spring pig slaughter, or the dried fish they had caught on regular days.

It looked like a lot, but this was a year's worth of food for seven or eight hundred people. If an emergency arose, it would even be sold for money. Therefore, they rarely had the chance to eat it on a normal day. Their daily meals were sorely lacking in meat.

True, there were only two or three hundred trackers, but they had families—children and wives. Although these dependents couldn't do much heavy labor, they still had mouths to feed. Naturally, life was never easy.

These trackers, along with some of their family members, clearly saw Li Qi return.

"Brother Li?!" they cried out in shock, joy surging in their hearts as they hurried over.

About five or six trackers and a few family members—a dozen people in total—swarmed around him. "Brother Li, how come you're back? Sixth Uncle said you wouldn't return until the end of the year!"

"Brother Li is back!"

"Brother Li is even wearing new clothes!"

"Where did you go this time, Brother Li? Sixth Uncle said you traveled far. I've never even been out of the city! What does it look like outside?"

Surrounded by this chaotic clamor of voices, Li Qi actually felt a sense of warmth. He clapped his hands together. "Settle down, settle down! Let's head back inside first. Don't block the street. Go on in, and someone go inform Sixth Uncle! We'll go back and talk slowly!"

Li Qi still held a fair amount of prestige among the trackers. At his command, they suppressed their burning questions, lowered their voices, and ushered him back inside in a disorderly cluster.

Once inside, Li Qi began distributing the items he had bought to each household.

The children were overjoyed, and the trackers' wives were even happier. The trackers themselves felt a bit bashful, but they all accepted the gifts nonetheless.

Because Li Qi told them he had money.

And so, they believed him.

A short while later, Sixth Uncle rushed back as well.
