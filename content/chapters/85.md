# Chapter 85: Contact

"Oh, isn't this Li Qi? Tsk, tsk, tsk. I heard you murdered someone and fled for your life. Why have you returned? Aren't you afraid of the constables? You caused a death right here. If you had just run away, that would have been one thing. But coming back... do you really think the magistrate's men would mind adding a little extra to their year-end performance reviews?" Seeing Li Qi return, Vegetable Head Zhang let out an odd noise, clicking his tongue incessantly.

This was exactly why Li Qi had fled in the first place.

Killing someone and fleeing was one thing. If you escaped, the constables would pretend it never happened. No case would be filed, and nothing would come of it. After all, nobody cared.

But if you stayed behind, they certainly wouldn't mind casually tossing you in a cell to pad their year-end performance.

Li Qi shook his head, offering no explanation.

Suddenly, Vegetable Head Zhang realized someone was standing right in front of him.

_So fast!_

_How did he charge in front of me without making a sound?!_

Of course he was fast!

In the mountains, Li Qi could wrestle and race against wild goats in the blink of an eye. His explosive speed allowed him to sprint half a li in under ten seconds.

And that was on mountain paths, which required climbing and leaping to traverse.

Now, on an unobstructed straight path, Vegetable Head Zhang didn't even have time to react before a dark blur crashed into him!

The very next second, his vision went black, and his chest felt entirely hollow.

It took several seconds for Vegetable Head Zhang to finally feel... the pain.

Agony assaulted him from every inch of his body.

The pain in his chest was exceptionally violent! He subconsciously fell to his knees, his body curling up like a boiled shrimp as he violently coughed.

"Cough... cough... _hurk_!"

Between the coughing and the retching, his lower half had completely lost control.

Saliva, tears, vomit, snot, and urine mixed together. He slumped into the pile of his own filth, his eyes vacant. Aside from the agonizing pain and the overwhelming nausea, he couldn't feel anything else.

This was to be expected. Li Qi's punch had struck his chest and abdomen dead-center, shattering several ribs in the process. He was likely suffering from internal bleeding. The fact that he survived this punch was a testament to his robust physique.

"Hey, Vegetable Head Zhang, don't just focus on pissing yourself. Weren't you asking about our joyous occasion?" Li Qi crouched down, looking at him with a calm expression. "The Wave-Rowing Gang's joyous occasion is that I've returned. That's why everyone is so happy. Is there a problem with that?"

But it was impossible for Vegetable Head Zhang to answer him.

His brain was completely muddled. He wasn't seeing stars; he was seeing pure darkness. His entire body convulsed from the excruciating pain. With his vision pitch black and his ears ringing fiercely, he was clearly incapable of responding to Li Qi.

Twenty men of Vegetable Head Zhang's caliber could attack him at once, and it would all be over in two or three seconds.

After entering the ranks, a fundamental gap opened between them and ordinary people.

Meanwhile, the other trackers were dead silent.

Like rusted machinery, their necks stiffly turned as they stared blankly at Li Qi.

They knew Brother Li had grown stronger since his return.

...But Vegetable Head Zhang commanded one or two hundred farmers. His cultivation method allowed him to borrow the strength of the earth, 'taking root' into the ground like a tree. It was claimed that as long as his feet were planted on the earth, he could take the full-force charge of a barbaric ox without taking a single step back.

This was a terrifying feat. A barbaric ox in this world was the equivalent of a light tank. To endure a tank's charge and force it to a halt with one's physical body...

This was Vegetable Head Zhang's strength, and it was the source of his courage to visit the Wave-Rowing Gang alone.

Even if he came, the Wave-Rowing Gang wouldn't be able to make him stay.

Yet Vegetable Head Zhang, the man who supposedly wouldn't budge an inch against a charging barbaric ox, had been crumpled into a ball by a single punch from Li Qi. Now curled on the ground like a shrimp, he couldn't even manage a single word between his bouts of vomiting and weeping.

The Martial Dao's Rank 9, combined with the explosive power of the Carp Stream Intent, allowed a full-strength strike to reach twenty or thirty thousand catties of force—the equivalent of four oxen.

Furthermore, the surface area of a fist was much smaller.

Having delivered his punch, Li Qi frowned at the dumbfounded crowd. He stood up and waved his hand.

"What are you staring at? Are you waiting for him to wake up? Haven't we done this kind of thing before?"

Those words instantly snapped the trackers out of their daze.

A wave of excitement washed over them as they cheered. Some searched for clubs, while others grabbed ropes. With methodical efficiency, they swiftly broke Vegetable Head Zhang's toes to prevent him from escaping, bound him tightly with thick ropes, and hoisted him into the air.

This was something they were intimately familiar with.

For bottom-tier gangs, brawls and life-and-death struggles were commonplace. In the past, Li Qi had led them through countless similar skirmishes!

Spurred by his reminder, the trackers' muscle memory kicked in. With a chaotic uproar, they surged forward, expertly breaking legs, binding their target, and stringing him up. They laughed as they tied the knots, then joined together in a chorus of cheers.

Just as they thought! Brother Li was still the same Brother Li!

He was still the smartest and bravest man in the gang, the loyal brother who always looked out for his peers!

Back when Brother Li led them out to fight over territory and profits, they would do this sort of thing all the time!

The seemingly foreign, overwhelmingly powerful Li Qi gradually merged with the familiar figure from their memories. The trackers cast aside their doubts. Once the deed was done, they swarmed around Li Qi.

Some praised him, while others chatted about mundane matters. Of course, most of them eagerly asked what exactly had happened to him over the past half-month.

"Enough! It's too noisy! All of you, be quiet. Go buy some wine and meat. We can talk more tonight over dinner!" Li Qi waved his hand, dismissing the crowd with a clear instruction.

Since Brother Li had spoken, the trackers naturally wouldn't be tactless. Joking and laughing, they happily draped their arms over one another's shoulders. Passing around the single gold piece Li Qi had given them, they took turns biting into it, marveling at the incredible rarity.

After all, none of them had ever touched real gold before.

This was actual gold!

Just this tiny piece was worth tens of thousands of copper coins!

Watching their antics, Li Qi couldn't help but sigh in admiration at Sixth Uncle's composure. Possessing a steady demeanor, the older man's first thought upon holding the gold was how to use it and how it should be divided.

Just then, he heard a loud _crack_.

"Hm...?" Curious about the sound, Li Qi looked back, only to see Sixth Uncle clutching his mouth and hopping in place from the pain, a golden cake firmly grasped in his other hand.

He had bitten the golden cake and chipped his tooth.

Old folks didn't have the strongest teeth.

Seeing this, Li Qi slapped his forehead.

_Fine. I retract my previous statement._

Better to focus on the matter concerning Vegetable Head Zhang first.

The man was already strung up, hanging limply in the air. He didn't even have the strength to lift his arms.

Li Qi grabbed a random tracker's waterskin and ruthlessly splashed it over Vegetable Head Zhang's face. Whatever else happened, waking him up was the first priority.

"Vegetable Head Zhang," Li Qi began, "now, would you care to tell me who this 'personage' backing you is? And why did you come alone to cause trouble for the Wave-Rowing Gang?"

However, immediately after Li Qi finished his question, the answer didn't come from Vegetable Head Zhang.

"Truly worthy of a kingdom's prefecture city. Hidden dragons and crouching tigers abound. To think that a Innate realm martial artist is hiding within this tiny tracker gang." A voice echoed from behind Li Qi. It sounded as though it originated from far away.
