# Chapter 83: Picking a Quarrel

Li Qi and Sixth Uncle immediately broke off their conversation and rushed outside.

They saw the trackers surrounding a burly man, the two sides seemingly embroiled in a conflict.

The loud crash from just moments ago had been the sound of wooden planks shattering.

Seeing this, Sixth Uncle furrowed his brow. He stopped Li Qi from stepping out and said, "Although the officials don't care, we shouldn't act too arrogantly. Let me go see what's going on first. You stay out of sight, or it might become awkward to handle if egos get involved."

Since Sixth Uncle put it that way, Li Qi paused and watched from a distance.

As Sixth Uncle walked over, the agitated trackers calmed down.

Sixth Uncle was the leader of the Wave-Rowing Gang. When he spoke, people listened.

Flanked by the trackers, Sixth Uncle walked to the front of the crowd. Looking at the well-proportioned, tall middle-aged man before him, he couldn't help but reveal a look of confusion.

"Vegetable Head Zhang, what is the meaning of this? Our Wave-Rowing Gang has no grievances with you. Coming right up to hit people and smash our doors—do you really think we have no temper? If you don't give us an explanation today, don't even think about shipping goods for your vegetable stalls through the Li River ever again!" Sixth Uncle stepped forward. Although he was a head shorter than Vegetable Head Zhang, his imposing aura was undiminished. He marched right up and pointed at the man's nose as he spoke.

"Oh? The Wave-Rowing Gang wiped out the Strong Force Gang last time, and now you've grown a temper? You want to blockade my vegetable shipments?" Vegetable Head Zhang crossed his arms, not the least bit nervous. "Haha, I almost thought you were a shipping gang for a second! A few lowly trackers pulling boats for the shipping gangs dare to speak to me like this? If you dare refuse my boats, do you think the shipping gangs will let you off?"

He was completely unafraid. After all, with boats constantly coming and going on the Li River, the ones who truly called the shots were the dozen or so shipping gangs and the docks. They were the ones who controlled the movement of the vessels.

The other boatmen, ferrymen, sailors, laborers, and trackers—all these gangs merely worked for them.

Above the shipping gangs was the Water Transport Commissioner, a genuinely high-ranking official! He was someone with true authority in the city; a single word from him could replace an entire crop of lower-level gangs.

Thus, Vegetable Head Zhang wasn't afraid in the slightest of his small vegetable boats being threatened.

"I might not dare refuse your orders, but I can make sure five out of ten of your boats capsize! You are nothing but a vegetable head selling greens in the East Market. If things get that ugly, do you think your stall head will spare you!?" Sixth Uncle yelled back, hands on his hips.

Listening from the sidelines, Li Qi gradually grasped the situation.

Why was this Vegetable Head Zhang coming over to stir up trouble for no reason?

According to the rules of Li Prefecture City's underclass, the gang leader who controlled a specific market was generally called a 'stall head.'

'Stall' referred to a cargo counter, acting as a general term for a market dealing in a certain business, or a specific category within a large market.

For example, there were food stalls, vegetable stalls, fish stalls, and the like.

And this 'vegetable head' was someone under a stall head who managed one specific line of business.

In the East Market's vegetable stalls, apart from the stall head, there were about a dozen such vegetable heads. Everyone had their own connections and networks.

Some had their own vegetable fields; some represented a specific village that only grew one type of crop; some were tied to merchants and could purchase wild greens from mountain villages. In short, all these vegetable heads possessed the ability to supply a certain vegetable to the market steadily.

Vegetable Head Zhang was one of the vegetable heads operating under the East Market's vegetable stalls in Li Prefecture City.

While this level of subdivision made his status seem unimpressive, in reality, he was far more prestigious than the Wave-Rowing Gang. Li Qi also knew Vegetable Head Zhang. He was in charge of selling cabbage, managing three boats and four carts, bringing fresh cabbages from the villages outside the city every day to sell at the stalls.

Occasionally, the Wave-Rowing Gang would also receive his orders to haul his vegetable cargo boats.

But for some unknown reason, why had he come to the Wave-Rowing Gang's turf to cause a scene today?

Li Qi quietly concealed his presence. He grabbed his long blade and hid behind the crowd, ensuring his figure was obscured so the other party couldn't easily spot him.

Hearing the threat of "five out of ten boats capsizing," Vegetable Head Zhang's expression visibly shifted. Clearly, the threat still carried weight.

Yet, he immediately took a step forward and cursed, "Trying to scare me? Do you think the Wave-Rowing Gang are the only ones in the whole city who know how to swim? I'll go to the Fishmonger Head; aren't those guys better in the water than you!?"

"Then go find them! I'll make you crawl to them today! Brothers, surround him! Break his legs if he dares to move!" At Sixth Uncle's command, the trackers instantly rushed out, forming a tight circle around Vegetable Head Zhang.

"You think your paltry skills can stop me? I might fear you in the water, but on land? You people?" Vegetable Head Zhang wasn't intimidated in the slightest. Drawing an ironwood club from his waist, he scanned his surroundings.

"Then why don't you try making a move?!" Sixth Uncle shouted, craning his neck.

The situation appeared incredibly volatile.

However, Li Qi knew a fight was unlikely to break out.

For people at the bottom, an injury could be fatal. They simply didn't have the capital to risk their lives so recklessly.

Moreover, from his perspective, the current standoff was an even match.

Could the Wave-Rowing Gang stop Vegetable Head Zhang?

Most likely not. Having greater numbers was useless. If Vegetable Head Zhang was willing to risk a broken arm or leg, forcing his way out truly wouldn't be difficult. If that happened, the Wave-Rowing Gang would inevitably suffer a dozen injuries, perhaps even deaths.

But was Vegetable Head Zhang afraid?

Even though he was shouting fiercely now, he was definitely feeling insecure inside. If his legs were truly broken, he would be too humiliated to ever show his face again.

When scraping by at the bottom rungs of society, face was always the most important thing. Without face and reputation, many minor issues would turn into insurmountable obstacles.

Therefore, in the end, it was highly probable that both sides would compromise and begin negotiating.

What he didn't know was... what was Vegetable Head Zhang thinking?

Why would he come all alone to the Wave-Rowing Gang's territory to pick a fight?

The farmers working in his vegetable gardens all had plenty of strength. If he had brought them along, the Wave-Rowing Gang would only be qualified to flee into the water to hide.

Yet he had come alone. If his legs really did get broken, the loss would be immense.

Sure enough, just as Li Qi expected, after both sides shouted and cursed for a while, they finally reached the point where it was time to talk.

"Vegetable Head Zhang, what are you really here for? If it's just to argue, our brothers aren't willing to entertain you any longer. If a real fight breaks out, you will be the only one to suffer." Sixth Uncle frowned, delivering what amounted to an ultimatum.

"Heh, let's cut the crap then. Does your Wave-Rowing Gang have a happy occasion today?" Seeing the topic shift from bickering to business, Vegetable Head Zhang dropped his pretentious act.

"Whether we have a happy occasion or not, what does it have to do with you?" Sixth Uncle's heart tightened, unsure of what the man meant.

After all, there was indeed a happy occasion: Li Qi had returned, and he had made something of himself. Wasn't that a massive cause for celebration?

"Of course it's none of my business. However, there's a big shot above me—a big shot comparable to the East City constable! He sent me here, telling me to inquire about your joyous event!" Vegetable Head Zhang bobbed his head, speaking with smug triumph.
