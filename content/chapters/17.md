# Chapter 17: Accident

Afterward, Li Qi and Ah Du spoke for a while longer. Once the two merchant groups had set off, they waited until they saw the others had gained some distance before they also hit the road.

During this period, Ah Du indeed taught Li Qi a method to stimulate vital energy and burst forth with higher vitality.

It was a song, very short, only twelve words.

"Oh, brilliant Seven Luminaries, shining brightly above! Oh, valiant warrior, how heroic, how heroic!"

Although the lyrics were short, it contained several different syllables. To truly sing it out was extremely difficult; the vocal style changed a lot and required coordination with one's breathing. It looked like a short sentence, but Li Qi spent an hour constantly repeating, attempting, and training before he could barely sing it.

However, he was not discouraged, because he could clearly see his progress through the progress bar. Furthermore, if there was anything wrong, the progress would regress.

This way, he could quickly grasp the trick, and his improvement was considerably fast.

So, not long after, his learning progress bar was full.

Once it was full, he could feel that although he had merely grasped it clumsily before, suddenly, in an instant, he understood the full essence of this song!

He verified this point once again: as long as the learning progress bar was full, he seemed to be able to directly master the thing he was studying, rather than being unpracticed like someone who had just grasped it.

This thing couldn't let him learn something directly, but it allowed him to become an old hand at it immediately after learning, without having to practice bit by bit.

As for that song, after singing it completely, Li Qi clearly felt his blood suddenly accelerate its flow!

It was like a ball of fire burning in his chest, wandering through his internal organs, almost as if it were about to spray out from his mouth.

His face was flushed red, and his entire body temperature was rising. Even his body became much lighter, and his feet, which had been somewhat stiff from the cold winter, quickly warmed up. He felt as if he had run five kilometers around a field.

But there was only boiling Qi and blood, not the usual fatigue.

A very marvelous sensation.

He could even feel the heat steaming fiercely from his forehead, dispelling the chill around him.

"This is really... the effect is very significant." Li Qi felt the heat on his body and looked at Ah Du with some surprise.

Ah Du, on the other hand, appeared even more surprised.

"Big Brother Li is truly intelligent. Back then, I studied for two or three hours. The stupid ones have to learn for a whole day! You actually learned it in such a short time, and you sang it so well!" Ah Du looked Li Qi up and down, seeming unable to believe this person could sing this song so well in such a short time.

"Maybe it's because I'm just smarter," Li Qi chuckled.

Ah Du was only surprised for a moment and didn't think much of it, immediately beginning to explain. "This song can spur the Pre-Heaven Three Treasures, making the Essence-Qi-Spirit active. This way, Yang qi becomes like fire, and mountain spirits and wild monsters dare not approach. The source is unknown, but don't use it too much; it consumes a lot of stamina. In the wild, being without stamina is scarier than mountain spirits and wild monsters—you might slip and fall."

Walking on the road, Ah Du explained things to Li Qi.

As long as one kept singing this song, it would continue to activate, but if one stopped, the effect would end immediately. It was very convenient.

According to Ah Du, when they used to travel as merchants in groups of a dozen or so, even if they encountered mountain spirits or wild monsters, as long as the dozen people gathered together and sang this song loudly, generally speaking, the creatures would retreat.

Chatting away, they had already been on the road for over an hour, and they could see the sky was about to turn dark.

Earlier, Li Qi had been a bit strange, asking why Ah Du insisted on drinking tea until evening before setting off, rather than traveling by day and finding a place to rest at night.

Ah Du's answer was: "This thing that's about to awaken into a spirit is rumored to be a wild dog. Most likely, it also rises with the sun and rests with the sunset. Going during the day makes it easier to run into it. At night, while it's asleep, maybe we can get lucky and slip right past. Look, those two merchant groups ahead of us, didn't they also drink tea all day and only move out near evening?"

There was no problem with this logic. In fact, the two merchant groups had indeed done exactly that.

After understanding the reason, Li Qi couldn't help but feel emotional. Indeed, merchants were well-informed and experienced. If he had followed his own plan of traveling by day and resting by night, he really might have run into that demon—said to be a wild dog.

Oh, it wasn't a demon yet, just close to becoming a spirit.

But it was still very powerful. At least for a mortal like Li Qi, it was very powerful.

Li Qi waited for the effect of the unknown song to dissipate. Since he had only sung it once, he just felt his hot blood boiling, but his body didn't feel weary, which was good.

As the two chatted about the specific situation, the sky gradually turned dark.

Their road also gradually narrowed. They had already walked twenty or thirty *li*; walking further meant entering the mountains. There were only blind, narrow paths to detour through, and they often had to climb slopes. Even walking by day was extremely dangerous; now that it was dark, it was even more terrifying. One might step into empty air and fall.

Fortunately, Ah Du was fully prepared. Unlike Li Qi, who only had a bundle containing money and food, Ah Du was experienced in the wild. He immediately took a torch from his basket, poured fire oil on it, and struck a flint to light it, so they wouldn't have to walk in the dark.

Li Qi felt somewhat ashamed. He was a fugitive murderer and had left in a hurry. No one in the Wave-Rowing Gang had experience with long-distance travel, leaving him with zero preparation. If not for Ah Du, it seemed his journey... would indeed have carried risks that were a bit too high.

But his luck was quite good to have met Ah Du; traveling together could be considered mutually complementary.

After all, if something really happened, he was definitely the one who could fight better.

Of course, it would be best if no fight occurred.

The two walked in the mountains. Although it could be counted as a dark and windy night, with the torch lighting the way, apart from annoying moths, the journey was uneventful.

However, halfway through, both of them shuddered simultaneously, pricked up their ears, and looked ahead.

In front of them, there were about ten merchants.

It was shockingly the same merchant group from the tea shed, the one that had even stood up to intimidate Li Qi.

Torches burned, making the surroundings bright. The ten or so men each held a chopper, striking them against one another while shouting unintelligible tones.

A dozen choppers struck out a series of clashing sounds of metal and soldiers, sounding like a battlefield.

The sound of weapons resonated through the night sky, combined with the shouts from the mouths of these dozen merchants, as if they were currently in battle—only the enemy was in the darkness, their whereabouts unknown.

Li Qi's horizons were broadened as he stared at these merchants. It appeared that in this world, every group indeed had its own unique skills. The Wave-Rowing Gang had the Wave-Shattering Force, and these merchants were no exception.

He could clearly see the progress bars rising from these merchants, which read:

<div class="rustic-frame">

Barrier Protection, 25%.

It seemed they had really encountered something and were relying on this series of clashing weapon sounds to resist it.

While he was still observing, he felt a gust of cold wind, causing him to involuntarily shiver.
