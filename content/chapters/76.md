# Chapter 76: Negotiation

The surrounding scenery was utterly bizarre.

All was an indistinct blur of primordial chaos, embodying the form of the Supreme Unity and the unfathomable depths of the profound void. The sun and moon lacked luster, the eight trigrams held no divinity, yin and yang could not be divided, and the four extremities could not be distinguished. The entirety of the space lacked any sense of direction or concept of rules.

A boundless expanse obscured the mortal dust in an instant, filling the air with hazy mists and churning, heavy clouds. Aside from a small clearing illuminated by a few flickering candles, everything else was completely shrouded in darkness.

Li Qi felt for his equipment.

His original clothes were gone, replaced by a simple white robe.

His long saber was also missing. It seemed that physical objects could not be brought into this place. Consequently, his clothes had been changed, and his weapon left behind.

However... the willow branch was still there.

As expected of the gift left by the Grand Invocator, it was remarkably reliable.

Gripping the willow branch wrapped around his waist, Li Qi felt his courage swell.

Hitching up his waistband, he took two steps forward and approached that mass of a 'ghost.'

"May I ask how to address you, departed one?" Li Qi asked.

At this very moment, within the space established by the power of the altar and the ritual, an Invocator could converse with Ghostly Gods.

To an outsider, Li Qi currently looked as though his eyes had rolled back into his head, perhaps performing a frenzied shamanic trance.

This was likely the reason why Shamans and Invocators often appeared mad and eccentric to the uninitiated. After all, his soul was essentially separated from his body at this moment.

"Just call me Elder Li," the mass of a ghost replied, its mind surprisingly lucid and its voice clear.

"My name is Li Qi. To think we share the same surname; perhaps we were of the same family five hundred years ago." Li Qi smiled, attempting to build a rapport.

The entity, however, did not buy it and cut straight to the point. "You are an Invocator of Shaman God Mountain. I have manifested to converse with you solely out of respect for Shaman God Mountain. What do you wish to say? Are you here to persuade me to forgive that insolent whelp who excavated my tomb and disturbed my peace?"

"Not at all. I am here primarily to offer you my assistance," Li Qi replied, cupping his hands in a polite salute.

He then continued, "The departed remains unable to enter the cycle of reincarnation and find peace, yet manages to maintain a clear mind. I suspect there is a deficiency in your physical remains, and you are merely enduring a bitter existence, sustained only by the auspicious waters of this blessed land."

"As an Invocator, it is my duty to seek the welfare of the world's Ghostly Gods. If I am not mistaken, you are enraged because your feng shui layout of 'harmonious clash of yin and yang, complete with the four directions and five earth elements' was ruined by a few hoes. Thus, you went to great lengths to cast a curse, wishing to vent your anger."

"Therefore, I have come to resolve your troubles. I have prepared top-tier yin wood. All that remains is to hire a craftsman to carve it, filling the gaps in your corpse with a wooden body. Then, it will be invigorated with Great Forest Wood qi to mend your deficiencies. Would this appease your regrets and dissipate your grievances?" Li Qi asked with cupped hands.

As he spoke, he channeled Great Forest Wood qi to his fingertips, revealing an abundance of vibrant vitality.

Carving wood into a body was a common method to mend the physical defects of the dead.

For example, the _Book of Tang_ recorded: "On the night of the eighteenth day of the tenth month, thieves broke into the residence of Fuguo, killed him, and fled with his head and arms. An edict ordered a wooden head to be carved for his burial, and he was posthumously granted the title of Grand Tutor."

Li Fuguo had been assassinated and his head went missing, so a wooden carving was used as a substitute for his head for the burial, and he was posthumously honored as Grand Tutor.

Similarly, the _Book of Qi_ recorded: "In the year of Jia-Yin[^1], during the fifth month of summer, there was a great drought. The corpse of a drought demon was found in Jinyang, measuring two feet long, with a pair of eyes on both the face and the top of the head. Upon hearing this, the Emperor ordered a wooden effigy carved in its likeness to be offered."

The _Biographies_ also stated: "There was a man named Wang Qiao whose entire family was abducted. Unable to find the corpses of his family members, he could only carve wooden effigies to summon their souls for burial, establishing a shrine and painting their portraits."

However, for this method to be effective, it fundamentally relied on using the qi within the wood to replace the Five Constant Virtues' qi within the deceased's body. Therefore, the requirements for the wood were stringent. The carving process involved numerous taboos and rules, and ultimately, an Invocator was required to perform a ritual for it to work. Thus, ordinary people could not utilize this method at all.

But wasn't this a perfect coincidence?

Although Li Qi had not yet entered the ranks, he was absolutely a genuine Invocator of Shaman God Mountain.

"...Even if you carve a body for me out of yin wood, they ruined my tomb. Are we supposed to just let that go?" the ghost said with a sinister edge.

"Then, does the departed have any other requests?" Li Qi asked, neither haughty nor humble.

"I want them buried with me! Are you not an Invocator of Shaman God Mountain? Use the lives of their entire family to hold a blood sacrifice for me, and this matter will be settled. I will naturally offer a gift in return, protecting you with my status as a Ghostly God," the ghost declared.

Hearing this, Li Qi frowned, then broke into a smile and spoke with ease. "Departed one, I am afraid you do not understand Invocators very well."

"I have heard that the Grand Invocator commands the nine sacrifices and the six vessels. The six vessels are the Azure Bi, the Yellow Cong, the Cyan Gui, the Red Zhang, the White Hu, and the Black Huang."[^2]

"The nine sacrifices are: first, the Ordering; second, the Spreading; third, the Roasting; fourth, the Temple; fifth, the Shaking; sixth, the Dipping; seventh, the Severing; eighth, the Burning; and ninth, the Communion."[^3]

Li Qi spoke with assurance, then changed the subject. "Yet, I have never heard... of any 'blood sacrifice'."

The atmosphere instantly turned chillingly cold.

The ghost visibly stilled.

However, after a few seconds, it replied. Though its tone was frosty, it said, "You are unrefined in your cultivation as an Invocator; I do not blame you. Think carefully. Although I do not know the ways of the Invocator, I know the Shaman Dao dictates: 'A blood sacrifice represents abundant qi. Sacrificing the lungs, liver, and heart values them as the masters of qi.' Does this not speak of a blood sacrifice?"

Li Qi's heart tightened. He had not expected the other party to be so knowledgeable as to know these texts!

The meaning of this passage was that using blood for a sacrifice seized the vigorous vital qi of the blood. Offering the lungs, liver, and heart as tributes to the gods was a testament to valuing them as the organs that generated vital qi.

_This is no ordinary spirit. It might truly be Rank 8._

However, he maintained a composed expression and replied, "Even so, the departed has already passed on. What use do you have for vital qi? The [Book of Invocation] also states: 'Sacrificing millet and sorghum, offering the five pure beverages along with bright water, is to requite the yin.' This should be much more suitable for the departed. How about using this as compensation?"

This sentence completely reversed the other party's argument.

The opposing party had brought up blood sacrifices; Li Qi immediately countered by suggesting a sacrifice of millet and sorghum, coupled with the five pure beverages and bright water. This was a sacrificial method capable of reciprocating Yin qi.

In short, a blood sacrifice was out of the question. However, on top of carving a wooden body, he could add another bargaining chip: a sacrifice that nourished Yin qi to aid the ghost's recovery.

After all, the deceased belonged to yin. This was already a gesture of immense sincerity.

"...Little Invocator, you are no match for me. Are you truly going to make an enemy of me for the sake of these grave robbers?" the ghost stated bluntly, dropping all pretense.

Li Qi's expression also darkened. "Departed one, I once heard a Rank 5 expert say that an Invocator is someone who harmonizes the conflicts between humans and gods, and between humans and ghosts. Is your conflict truly so immense that it must be paid in blood?"

As he spoke, Li Qi subtly hinted at his backing to intimidate the other party.

After all, Shen Shuibi was also Rank 5, wasn't she?
