# Chapter 23: Chance Encounter

He wasn't some hungry ghost who would devour anyone he caught...

At this moment, a merchant suddenly said, "If you ask me, Brother Li Qi, if you really crave her body, why not just take her right here? She hasn't woken up anyway. Once you're done and had your fun, just throw her by the roadside. You can't let her drag you down for life, right?"

"Besides, you're her savior. It's only natural for her to repay you with her body, isn't it?" the merchant added with a lewd chuckle.

There wasn't a shred of humanity in his words. Li Qi's brow furrowed in displeasure. He stood up and walked toward the woman, forcing a joking tone. "Hey, what do you mean, 'take her right now'? Do I look like…"

Before he could finish, the woman shuddered and her eyes fluttered open.

"Ah, you're awake?" Li Qi was delighted and breathed a sigh of relief. It was good she was awake; now he didn't have to struggle with the decision.

"Miss, what is your name?" He decisively walked up and asked her.

Who would have thought that this beautiful woman would shrink back, her face full of terror, and say with a trembling voice, "I… I'm very powerful. Y-you, stay away from me…"

Shen Shuibi never dreamed that she would fall to this state today.

When she served her Ladyship in the past, although it wasn't exactly a life of luxury, at least there were servants for chores. She only needed to listen to her Ladyship and give orders to the servants.

But when her Ladyship lost power and was forced to flee to Baiyue, she naturally followed. Not only did she suffer greatly along the way, but she also became separated from her Ladyship and was stranded in the Hundred Thousand Mountains.

Those Human Dao cultivators not only shattered her dharma treasures but also implanted a spiritual imprint into her cultivation base, forcing her to disperse her own cultivation to escape their surveillance.

She thought she could finally catch her breath. She found an abandoned ruined temple, enlightened a wild dog, and prepared to rest for a while. But then she encountered someone who practiced the unique spell arts of the Grand Invocator of Baiyue. He might very well be a disciple or follower of some Invocator, protected by the power of ghosts and gods, able to divine fortune and misfortune, and even reverse seasonal rains, calm winds and droughts, avert disasters of war, and distance plagues. His body was filled with all sorts of strange and wondrous divine abilities.

She had read ancient books. Among the shamans, the most supreme were the Grand Diviner and the Grand Invocator.

The Grand Diviner controls the Three Omens method: the Jade Omen, the Tile Omen, and the Plain Omen. The manifestations of these omens number one hundred and twenty, and their interpretations number one thousand two hundred.

He also controls the Three Changes method. Their primary trigrams are eight, and their variations are sixty-four.

He further controls the Three Dreams method: the Induced Dream, the Strange Dream, and the All-Ascending Dream. Their primary cycles are ten, and their variations are ninety. Using state affairs to create the Eight Commands of the Turtle, and with these Eight Commands to assist the divinations of the Three Omens, Three Changes, and Three Dreams, he observes the fortune and misfortune of the world and calculates the destiny of all living beings.

The Grand Invocator can initiate the Grand Rite, sacrificing to human ghosts, heavenly gods, and earthly divinities. Using his own body, he harmonizes human ghosts, heavenly gods, and earthly divinities to be used by humans. He controls the Six Calamities and Six Prayers, composes the Six Odes, discerns the Six Titles, the Nine Sacrifices, and the Nine Obeisances. Weilding fire and water, he serves ghosts and gods through invocation. Ghosts and gods protect him, ancestral spirits accompany him, and heavenly gods, earthly divinities[^1], and the gods of the four directions all bless him. His power is terrifying.

The Grand Diviner and the Grand Invocator are both the top powerhouses of the Shaman Dao. Before the invasion of the Human Dao, they were the undisputed rulers of Baiyue.

The Myriad Beast Art was a spell art unique to the Grand Invocator's lineage, an exclusive privilege of the Invocators.

When she came out and confirmed that it was indeed the Ox Strength Art bestowed by the Hundred Beast Earthly Divinity, unique to the Grand Invocator's lineage, she was scared witless on the spot.

After thinking for a long time, she decided to flee immediately. After all, the wild dog had no intellect and was just a mad dog; she had only used it for temporary protection.

For this reason, she summoned this black mist.

This was a spell art known as Burial Qi Art.

_Burial is concealment; it is the harnessing of vital qi._

Vital qi is the breath of primordial unity in motion. In the heavens, it circulates through the six voids[^2]; on earth, it gives birth to the myriad things. Without it, the heavens lack the means to endow qi, and the earth lacks the substance to support form. Moreover, vital qi lies hidden within the earth, invisible to the human eye.

The Burial Qi Art is just like this: it channels vital qi outward, making oneself invisible to humans, losing all traces.[^3]

Yet, she didn't know what divine abilities the other party possessed, but he could see right through the black mist!

It would have been fine if he just saw through it, but he just happened to be accompanied by a 'choppers squad' that had killed who knows how many pigs!

The clashing of choppers triggered the baleful qi on the blades. _Where water flows improperly and spirits wander, all carry violent killing energy._ This was the nemesis of vital qi, forcing the black mist to recede, and she was grabbed directly.[^4]

Shen Shuibi was well aware of her injuries. Leaving aside the injuries, to evade the search, she had dispersed her own cultivation...

This was very awkward.

So, she simply used her innate skill subconsciously, purely out of instinct.

She was a rabbit demon who had already taken human form.

What is the innate skill of a rabbit demon?

It is playing dead...

Praying in her heart, _You can't see me... you can't see me... you can't see me..._ Then, hoping the other party would find it unlucky or troublesome and throw her by the roadside—that would be best.

But unexpectedly, this Invocator... turned out to be a good person.

He insisted on carrying her for an hour at a critical moment.

_Heavens, if you're so kind, can't you just let me go!_

Shen Shuibi was on the verge of tears in her heart.

However, she was soon about to cry for real.

She listened to those people persuading Li Qi to throw her away, and she secretly rejoiced. As long as he threw her by the roadside, she could immediately take to her heels and run.

However, that guy named Li Qi just wouldn't do it!

She thought it was just kindness, but that Ba Kui nearby pointed it out at once: Li Qi was actually after her body!

Honestly speaking, she could barely keep up the act then. Shen Shuibi had grown up by her Ladyship's side since childhood; where had she ever seen such things?

She barely managed to hold it together, and then she heard someone say... just take her right there and then dump her body in the wilderness.

To tell the truth, she almost wet herself.

As a rabbit demon, she had encountered life-and-death crises in her life. Although she grew up with her Ladyship, she was separated earlier and pursued. Even though most pursuers went after her Ladyship, she still almost didn't escape.

But a life-and-death crisis was one thing; this was a different nature altogether.

And that Li Qi...

This person seemed to have listened to them.

He walked straight towards her.

And he was smiling!

That "hehehe" laughter made Shen Shuibi's rabbit ears almost pop out.

Why would rabbit ears pop out? Because she was scared into revealing her original form.

Rabbits are timid by nature, and now she couldn't keep playing dead.

She steeled her heart, clenched her small fists, and made a secret resolution!

Things having come to this, she had no choice but to wake up suddenly and fight him to the end!

So what if he was an Invocator? A rabbit can be killed, but not humiliated.

Just... wait, he didn't seem to care whether she was dead or alive. When she was playing dead earlier, he didn't seem to mind and was ready to come right at her...

It's over.

The moment she thought of this, Shen Shuibi immediately wilted.

Then came the scene from just now.

She opened her eyes tremblingly, shrinking her neck, staring at Li Qi, scared to death.

As for Li Qi...

[^1]: Human Ghosts, Heavenly Gods, Earthly Divinities will be explained later in the story.
[^2]: **Six Voids**: In Daoist cosmology and the I Ching, the "Six Voids" (or Six Hollows) typically refer to the six directions of the universe: North, South, East, West, Up, and Down. It represents the entirety of space where Qi flows.
[^3]: The author is playing on the double meaning of "Burial" (葬). In the classic Book of Burial, it is stated that "Burial is concealment" (hiding the body). This technique applies that principle to the living: just as the earth hides the "vital qi" within it, this art wraps the user in that same qi to hide them from the world. Basically, burying them, but not underground.
[^4]: **Why does blade clashing generate baleful qi?**
    
    Blades are Metal. In five elements theory, metal is associated with:
    
    * Sharpness, cutting, severance
    * Autumn, decline, death
    * The killing aspect of nature
    
    The violent action of clashing blades generates a sharp, aggressive energy which is the baleful qi.
    
    Regarding the water connection: _Where water flows improperly and spirits wander, all carry violent killing energy._ This is a very interpretive translation.
