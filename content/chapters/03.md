# Chapter 3: Progress

That fair-faced young scholar, dressed in cotton robes, was holding up the very same half of a game console that Li Qi had thrown away back then!

Then, to his even greater shock, a large burly man walked out from the Strong Force Gang holding the other half that he had pulled from his robes!

_Fuck! My house was robbed?!_

These people went to his house and stole his game console?

Although the thing was already broken—he had only found half of it to begin with—he had kept it in his house as a keepsake, a reminder of his past.

The Strong Force Gang actually took advantage of River Breaking, when no one was home at the Wave-Rowing Gang, to send someone to steal it?

What secret did his game console hold? How was the thrown-away half found, and the half in his room stolen as well?

_Are they looking to die?!_ Not only was that thing useless, but if he reported it to the officials and they got caught, they would face heavy punishment.

The constables of this world were no pushovers. They could fly through the heavens and burrow into the earth, divine locations and track traces. Their professional skills were incredibly strong. The thieves who usually contended with them had to be at least on the level of the legendary Bandit Saint Bai Zhantang.

Mere trackers daring to steal would definitely be caught and made into an example.

He had always been tight-lipped about his transmigration, but looking at it now... something seemed wrong.

He was careful not to make a sound, but his eyes stared dead at that young scholar.

That person held up the pieced-together game console with both hands and looked at the crowd.

"Do you all know why I came here, and why I posted a bounty, promising a spell art to whoever could bring me this strange object?" the young scholar said, holding up the game console.

The large men below shook their heads in unison; even the leader of the Strong Force Gang standing beside the young scholar was no exception.

Seeing them shake their heads, the young scholar’s expression took on a hint of superiority.

"We seekers of the Dao... some pursue the Heaven Dao, grasping the power of nature, controlling earth, fire, water, and wind. With a snap of the fingers, they call the wind and summon the rain; with a wave of the hand, they condense soil into steel. They know the secrets of heaven and understand gain and loss, seeking fortune and avoiding calamity, free from disaster and tribulation."

"Some pursue the Human Dao, gathering the hearts of the masses, manipulating the destiny of all people. Amidst the whistling wind, they sweep away armies; sitting in the hall, they enjoy the offerings of the world. They can establish kingdoms and form divine dynasties, drawing upon the strength of the multitude for themselves. The various kingdoms of this world are all followers of the Human Dao."

"And some pursue the Reason Dao, seeking the logic behind the operation of artifacts, taking logic for their own use. Offensively, they create armaments and mechanisms; defensively, they build majestic passes and towering cities. They distinguish laws and perceive the truth. This is called 'clarifying all things,' those who use reason to distinguish all things."

He spoke with fervor and assurance, his expression triumphant.

However, just as he wanted to continue, he saw that the surrounding burly men all looked completely bewildered, their faces full of dull stupidity, clearly not understanding a word.

His original triumph and pride instantly deflated. His face fell, and he sighed. "Sigh, forget it. You lot are as stupid as pigs and dogs. Naturally, you would not understand the great meaning within."

Then, he regained his calm expression and raised the game console. "However, although you only know how to sell your strength like livestock, I am unwilling to deceive you. This is an object born of one of the Daos, known as the 'Outer Dao'."

"Among the various Daos, the Heaven Dao is the highest, commanding ten thousand paths. However, there is one Dao that does not submit to the jurisdiction of the Heaven Dao, nor is its origin known. The Reason Dao cannot rationalize its laws. This Dao has been named the Outer Dao."

"More than three years ago, while in the mountains, I detected an anomaly through divination. However, objects of the Outer Dao are strange and unpredictable, and divination methods struggle to find their traces."

"Thus, I spent two and a half years initiating a Grand Rite. Only then did I calculate it to your Strong Force Gang. The results of the Grand Rite hinted to me that the Strong Force Gang could obtain an Outer Dao object for me. So, I came down the mountain and had you act on my behalf, using manpower to search for me."

"This is the reason you all had to search the mountains for the past few months, and also the reason you couldn't obtain the qualification for River Breaking. After all, your energy was focused on finding the item for me. I didn't say anything before simply because I was worried you would leak the news."

He explained this to the burly men of the Strong Force Gang.

But on the other side, Li Qi, who was listening to all of this, was simply stunned.

The Strong Force Gang failed to get the qualification for River Breaking because this person directed them?

Outer Dao? Isn't that just a damn transmigrator?! This person divined my existence? _Fuck, doesn't that mean I'm in mortal danger?!_

_Wait, calm down. He just said, "objects of the Outer Dao are strange and unpredictable, and divination methods struggle to find their traces." It was precisely because of this that he only calculated the existence of an Outer Dao object but didn't know exactly what it looked like._

Even just calculating the game console, he only felt a slight anomaly, and later spent a full two and a half years initiating a Grand Rite just to pin down the clue to the Strong Force Gang.

Although Li Qi didn't know what a Grand Rite was, simply spending two and a half years meant it was definitely not an easy task.

Looking at it this way, the fact that he was a transmigrator shouldn't have been exposed?

_Setting that aside, let's observe a bit longer._

He knew the roots of that game console. That thing was just a piece of junk. Aside from the attribute of being an Outer Dao object, it was useless. The motherboard was snapped; what use could it have? It was just a collectible.

However, the spell art that the young scholar gave to the Strong Force Gang might affect the future structure of the three tracker gangs in the city. He needed to at least pry into some details here.

Moreover... this was his first time truly coming into contact with the aspect of this world beyond the lowest level.

He had never heard of the theory of the various Daos. Having been a tracker for three years, his understanding of this world was far too little, confined to the lowest level of society. He had to consider carefully even when eating vegetables, and eating meat relied solely on rewards.

He didn't want to work in the tracker gang for his whole life.

However, no one cared about Li Qi's internal monologue. The young scholar, after rambling on about why he sought out the Strong Force Gang, joyfully put away the game console.

"Ahem, we who practice the Shaman Dao must not go against our original heart. My original heart is pure, kind, and honest, so I am unwilling to hide things from you. Therefore, since I have revealed the matter of driving you, I will not be stingy with the reward I owe you."

"This spell art is your reward." The young scholar waved his hand gently, and a streak of purple light condensed in his palm.

Upon witnessing that purple light, Li Qi suddenly felt a thunderous roar in his brain!

It was as if a sledgehammer had smashed into his head. Stars danced wildly before his eyes in an instant, and a strong urge to vomit assaulted him. His legs went soft, and he slipped directly to the ground, tumbling out from the corner!

_Crap!_

This scared him into a cold sweat. Although his head still ached violently, he forced himself to look up, wanting to stand.

However, when he looked up, he discovered that the other burly men were just like him, clutching their heads and howling in pain on the ground, some even rolling around. The young scholar had already turned his back, preparing to return to his room.

No one noticed him!

_Opportunity!_

Even though the pain caused cold sweat to stream down and his vision to go black, he immediately propped up his body. With a brain that felt like it was boiling, he stumbled and ran toward the distance.

But before leaving, he looked back once more.

That glance happened to catch the leader of the Strong Force Gang, who was rolling on the ground, locking eyes with Li Qi.

"Someone is there!" he struggled to roar!

As for Li Qi, danger and terror swept through his entire body, so much so that he couldn't even maintain a train of thought. He only remembered one thing.

_Run! Run fast! Or I won't be able to escape!_

Stumbling and staggering, he ran wildly all the way, knocking over quite a few people on the road, unaware of how many passersby shouted curses at him.

There was even a burly man who, after being bumped, gave him a punch right away, knocking him to the ground and causing half his face to swell up.

But Li Qi seemed oblivious, crawling on the ground, his eyes vacant, his mouth just muttering, "Run... run fast..."

That burly man wanted to hit him again but, seeing this scene, his anger turned to disgust, and he spat. "Pah, turns out it's a madman. This lord won't lower himself to argue with you."

After speaking, he kicked him once more and then swaggered away.

Li Qi felt absolutely nothing.

Because he could no longer feel his own body.

His current sensation was as if someone were using iron hooks to stab into his nose and ears, and then scraping his brain matter out bit by bit.

Almost unimaginable pain completely destroyed his sanity. Aside from the thought of fleeing for his life, he could no longer think.

Just like that, practically rolling and crawling, he rushed back to the riverbank.

The second track hadn't ended yet, so the people from the Wave-Rowing Gang were still there.

He barely managed to run there before falling to the ground and rolling twice.

"Brother Li!?" Someone discovered him first.

"Brother Li is injured! Quick, go call Uncle Liu," a tracker immediately said.

Having arrived here, Li Qi finally breathed a sigh of relief. As soon as his taut nerves relaxed, intense dizziness struck, dragging him directly into the abyss of unconsciousness.

Everything went black.

His body felt as if it were pressed down by a giant boulder, unable to move.

Suddenly, streams of data flashed before his eyes.

He had learned programming before, and vaguely remembered... _does this look like memory loading?_

_Why... would I see data streams?_

In his daze, a doubt emerged in Li Qi's faint consciousness.

But those data streams swept past quickly and then vanished.

Finally, a string of error messages arrived!

The entire data stream turned directly into red, piling up in his mind with swishing sounds, completely occupying his vision.

Then, a massive 'ERROR' occupied all his thoughts.

"Ugh—! Ah!" This sensation made him howl in pain!

Then, all sensation came to an abrupt halt. He violently flipped over and sat up, his body drenched in cold sweat, his clothes soaked as if he had just come out of the water.

"Brother Li is awake! Water, bring water!" a tracker shouted.

"Water my ass! Meat soup, meat soup!" Uncle Liu knocked that person on the head and shouted to the tracker beside him.

"Right, right, right, meat soup, bring the soup over!" that person hurriedly said.

A bowl of meat soup was passed by pairs of hands. Although the trackers couldn't stop swallowing their saliva, it was still quickly passed to Li Qi's hands.

Li Qi, however, had a look of horror in his eyes. He was flustered, trembling so much he couldn't even hold the bowl.

Seeing the soup about to spill, Uncle Liu immediately reached out, took it, and brought it to his mouth.

Li Qi subconsciously gulped it down, finishing the soup and meat cleanly. His stamina and hydration replenished, he finally recovered some strength.

Seeing this, Uncle Liu supported Li Qi and waved to the other trackers, "Don't crowd around watching, it stinks to high heaven! Clear out some space, let the wind blow in. If you're idle, go guard the second track. We're about to take over, don't delay the serious business."

Hearing this, although the other trackers were somewhat worried, they still followed Uncle Liu's words and all walked outside.

Uncle Liu supported Li Qi, slowly helping him into the shed on the river pier. This was a place fishermen used to rest.

"What happened? How did you end up like this?" After helping him inside, he asked Li Qi anxiously.

Because the current Li Qi had a horrified expression, half his face was swollen, and he was covered in dust from head to toe, looking like he had rolled all the way back.

He knew this young man, Li Qi. Although his origins were unknown, he was steady in his work, intelligent, could speak a lot of reason, and had very strong talent. He had trained the Wave-Shattering Force to great success in just two years, something many old trackers who had trained for ten years couldn't achieve.

Although the Wave-Shattering Force was a crude cultivation method that reached its limit at just one layer, it was still a cultivation method. To achieve great success in two years, he was still the most talented person Uncle Liu had ever seen.

How could such a person be frightened like this?

But Li Qi did not answer him.

Because in his eyes, the world had changed.

He didn't look at Uncle Liu but stared dead at the River Breaking site outside.

Under the large ship for River Breaking, a very abrupt, very tacky-styled frame appeared below it.

It even had a line of Chinese characters written on it:

<div class="rustic-frame">

"River Breaking Ceremony, Progress 46%."

</div>

Corresponding to this line of text, inside that box, there was also a progress bar, with the progress precisely just a little short of halfway.

He looked at the tracker drinking soup on the other side.

A line of text and a similarly tacky frame popped up under the tracker.

<div class="rustic-frame">

"Eating, Progress 84%."

</div>

There was an identical progress bar in the frame, and it quickly finished running, turning into 100%.

At the same time the progress bar turned to 100%, that tracker just happened to finish the meat soup.

Then, he put down the bowl and let out a long breath.

The progress bar above the tracker's head changed to "Resting, Progress 1%."

"Little Li? Li Qi?" At this moment, Uncle Liu's face appeared before Li Qi's eyes. He leaned in front of Li Qi, his expression worried, brows furrowed tight.

Li Qi could clearly see that above Uncle Liu's head, there was a progress bar identical to the previous two.

<div class="rustic-frame">

"Observing Words and Expressions, Progress 21%."

</div>

Inside that frame, it impressively displayed what Uncle Liu was doing right now!

"Little Li?" Uncle Liu raised his volume.

"Eh!" Li Qi hurriedly answered. He suppressed the doubts in his heart and temporarily did not pursue what had popped up before his eyes.

"What happened? What did you encounter? Are you injured?" Seeing Li Qi finally respond, Uncle Liu asked hurriedly.

"No, no, I'm fine." Li Qi stood up, shaking his head while walking to the edge of the shed. He looked around, then asked, "How long was I unconscious? Did anyone chase after me?"

"You were out for less than a quarter of an hour. No one chased after you. Were you discovered by the Strong Force Gang?"

"Yes, I saw that the Strong Force Gang somehow hooked up with an expert who transmitted a new spell art to them!"

_Spell art!_

Hearing these two words, Uncle Liu's face turned pale instantly.
