# Chapter 34: The Learned Fool

Li Qi felt around his person; he had nine hundred and ninety-two coins.

Crap, the new boss only gave him the cultivation method and that willow branch, but no money!

He could make do on his own—sleeping in the wild, under a bridge, or at worst, on the street.

But now there was a woman with him… and a richly dressed one at that, with her gauze scarf and silk clothes, looking clean, white, and obviously wealthy.

_Seriously, this doesn't seem very safe. How could they possibly sleep on the streets?_

The most critical issue was that there were no guards or escorts. Her only companion was Li Qi himself, a ragged boat tracker who looked like a pauper at a glance.

Going out with this getup felt like telling everyone: "Come rob me! Come steal from me! Not only am I rich, but I also look completely incapable of resisting!"

So, Li Qi took a couple of steps down the street to divert this Miss Shen's attention, and then said to her, "Miss Shen, my name is Li Qi, though you should already know that."

"Mmh, Li Qi, I am Shen Shuibi." Shen Shuibi's attention was successfully diverted, and she seemed to have already forgotten her earlier indignation.

This made Li Qi sigh with emotion.

_This demon really is a blockhead. No wonder the world belongs to the human race. If they all had brains like this, it'd be a miracle if humans didn't rule._

_Oh, wait, that's not right… I guess you'd call it… innocence?_

_I really wish everyone in the world were this innocent._

Li Qi led Shen Shuibi all the way to a riverside.

He squatted by the river, while Shen Shuibi stood behind him, confused, seemingly unsure of what they were doing.

Then, Li Qi spoke up, "Miss Shen, we're about to go to our deaths… ah, no, embark on a journey together. We should probably get to know each other. Aside from your name, I don't know anything about you."

"But getting acquainted should be a two-way street, so let me introduce myself first."

Li Qi spoke as he began his introduction.

His life story was quite thin. Aside from being a person of the Outer Dao, which wasn't something he could easily discuss, he couldn't very well tell her he was a transmigrator, could he?

Although, being a person of the Outer Dao didn't seem to be a big deal, and judging by the Young Master Zhu, there seemed to be quite a few of them...

_I wonder if I'll ever get the chance to meet someone from back home?_

Besides that, he simply introduced himself as a boat tracker and started telling some stories from his time pulling boats.

Things like his battles of wits with Big Strong Shan, and the mountain sprites and water monsters he encountered while hauling boats.

Usually, when they ran into those sprites and monsters, the powerful figures backing the boat owners would take care of them, rather than sending the boat trackers to their deaths.

After all, the people who could run boat businesses were not on the same level as mere trackers.

He also recounted some of the local legends he had heard around the docks, stories of water-gu insects, water monkeys, and witches casting spells.

He told his stories, completely capturing Shen Shuibi's attention. She had never heard such things before and was clearly treating Li Qi like a storyteller.

"So, because of the Shamans, here in our Great Deer Kingdom, if a child falls gravely ill, most people won't look for a doctor. Instead, they'll seek out a shaman to cure the sickness," Li Qi said, recounting some of the strange things he had seen in the Baiyue region.

Right then, he happened to be talking about the street-wandering witches who, in Li Qi's view, filled the role of barefoot doctors, using herbs or mystical cultivation methods to treat illnesses.

However, at this moment, Shen Shuibi suddenly spoke.

"I know about this. A Confucian scholar once wrote a book about the affairs of Baiyue, stating: 'The people of Baiyue customarily revere Shamans. When a person is ill, they will invariably consult a Shaman with their eight characters. When the Shaman arrives, they break a chicken egg and observe the white and yolk to determine the severity of the illness. For a mild case, they perform a warding ritual with wine and food; for a severe one, they paint a divine image in the hall, and the Shaman, dressed as a beautiful woman, blows an ox horn, strikes a gong, and dances, singing while carrying a chicken on a flowered staff. These dances are called the Dance of Soul Redemption and the Dance of Womb Breaking. The songs are called the Chicken Song and the Flower-Warming Song. For the latter, if a male infant is sick, the Shaman surrounds him with a ring of colorful flowers, has relatives each point to a flower and offer a blessing, and then sings; this is called warming the flower. The Shaman will also cut their own arm to smear blood on a talisman; this is called Revealing the Yang.' This describes how the people of the Baiyue region use Shamans to treat illness, not doctors."

"Therefore, that same scholar also criticized the ignorance of Baiyue, noting that in the countryside, you might find ten shamans but would be hard-pressed to find a single physician. The common folk inevitably live in hardship. One must understand that while shamans can cure illnesses, they cannot prevent them. A physician, besides curing the sick, can also get to the root of the matter, investigate the cause of a disease, and treat it fundamentally. Curing one person can prevent a hundred more from falling ill, whereas a shaman can only treat patients one by one—a futile effort like using a cup of water to put out a burning cart."

Listening to her words, Li Qi turned his head to look at her, his face filled with astonishment.

_This woman… ah, no, this female demon, though she strikes me as a fool, can speak with such eloquence. It was the same when she spoke of the willow branch, citing classics off the cuff as if she's read countless ancient books._

_But despite having read so many books and possessing so much knowledge… how is she still such an airhead?_

"That's exactly right. The scholar makes a very good point," Li Qi agreed wholeheartedly. Those shamans could cure illnesses, but once the job was done, it was done; they often didn't even know how they'd cured the disease themselves.

Li Qi had experienced it himself. While hauling boats, he had been infested by water-gu parasites, causing his belly to swell up, round and distended, filled with writhing worms. He paid for a shaman who performed a ritual and danced for him. Before long, the water-gu were all dead, and he expelled them completely.

But even though he was cured, Li Qi had no idea how to prevent it from happening again or how to keep others from getting sick. Even the shaman didn't know; he could only treat cases as they came.

Hearing Li Qi agree with her, Shen Shuibi let out a smug little hum.

_She really is… so carefree._

They had been chatting for about twenty minutes, and she seemed to have completely forgotten her earlier displeasure.

This was exactly what Li Qi had intended, though even he hadn't expected it to be so immediately effective.

He wasn't sure if his conversation skills were just that good, or if his target was simply too gullible.

So he decided to strike while the iron was hot and continued, "I've told you so much about myself, Miss Shen, but you haven't said anything about yourself. How did you end up in the Great Deer Kingdom?"

The topic having shifted, Shen Shuibi didn't sense anything amiss. "Me? I don't have as many stories as you. I'm just Her Ladyship's rabbit. I've been by her side since I was little. When Her Ladyship read, I read. When Her Ladyship cultivated, I cultivated. When Her Ladyship ate, I ate. It's been like that for about a hundred years, I guess? Then, as you know, Her Ladyship was being hunted. Halfway through her escape, she was afraid I'd be killed by the aftershocks of the battle, so she left me in Great Deer."

"Only, my luck was bad. I was tainted by a spell art from the pursuers. That thing transformed into my defensive qi, feeding on my cultivation, and also revealed my location."

"The floating qi that does not follow the meridians is defensive qi. However, defensive qi and nutritive qi follow one another as Yin and Yang, penetrating both outside and inside; it could not be eradicated. I could only abandon all my cultivation and destroy my own cultivation body to break free from that spell art."
