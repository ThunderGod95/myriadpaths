# Chapter 74: The Sacrificial Rite

As for why the vast majority of ghosts became muddled and senseless, the reason was quite simple.

The Human Ghost chapter of the [Book of Invocation] contained a clear record: "When a man dies and becomes a ghost, he possesses no consciousness. How is this proven? By the fact that before birth, there is no consciousness. Before a man is born, he exists within the primordial qi; upon death, he returns to the primordial qi. The primordial qi is formless and vague, and human qi exists within it. If a man has no consciousness before birth, and returns to this root of unconsciousness upon death, how can he possess consciousness? The reason a man possesses intelligence and wisdom is that he harbors the qi of the Five Constant Virtues. The reason the qi of the Five Constant Virtues resides within a man is due to the five viscera within his physical form. When the five viscera are unharmed, the man is intelligent; when the five viscera are diseased, the man becomes muddled. Once muddled, he becomes foolish and ignorant. When a man dies, his five viscera rot away. Once they rot away, the qi of the Five Constant Virtues has nothing to rely upon. The vessel used to house intelligence has perished, and the source of intelligence has departed. Form requires qi to be created, and qi requires form to possess consciousness. There is no fire in the world that burns on its own without fuel, so how could there be essence qi in this world that possesses consciousness independent of a physical form?"

The meaning was that when a dead person became a ghost, they no longer possessed any intellect to speak of. How could this statement be verified?

It was very simple. Before a person was born, they existed within the primordial qi of heaven and earth. After they died, they returned to that primordial qi.

Primordial qi was vague and indistinct, and the qi that constituted a human existed within it. Therefore, before a person was born, they had no perception. After they died, they would return to that original state of imperception. How, then, could a ghost possess perception?

This was the so-called cycle of reincarnation. There was no such thing as the legendary Meng Po's soup of forgetfulness. The Nether Court simply collected the qi of all things, cleansed it, and then cast it back into heaven and earth to complete a grand cycle.

The reason humans possessed intelligence and wisdom was that they contained the qi of the Five Constant Virtues. This qi could exist within the human body because of the five viscera. If the five viscera were unharmed, the person had wisdom. If the five viscera were diseased, the person's mind would become clouded, and a clouded mind led to foolishness and dementia.

When a person died, their five viscera would rot away. Once the five viscera rotted, the qi of the Five Constant Virtues would have no place to reside.

The organs used to house wisdom had decayed, and the qi of the Five Constant Virtues used to generate wisdom had left the body. Physical form relied on qi to be generated, and qi relied on physical form to produce perception. There was no fire under heaven that could burn independently of a physical object. How could there be essence qi in this world that could independently produce perception detached from a physical form?

This was also why ghosts were taken away within seven days. Within seven days, the five viscera had not yet completely decayed. Although their qi of the Five Constant Virtues was like water without a source or fire without fuel, it still existed and could maintain a brief period of consciousness. Once the corpse rotted away, they would become completely senseless.

Human death was like the extinguishing of a fire. Once the fire went out, its light no longer shone. Once a person died, their perception ceased to function.

Therefore, ordinary ghosts could not harm people.

"Just as an unhatched chicken egg is a chaotic liquid within its shell; if broken and observed, it takes the form of water. Only after a good hen incubates it does its body take shape, and once formed, it can peck and kick. A man's death is like that chaotic liquid state. How can chaotic qi harm anyone?"

So why could certain malicious ghosts harm people?

It was because they relied on tools, just as water could drown and fire could burn.

"All things that can harm men belong to the Five Elements. Metal wounds men, wood beats men, earth crushes men, water drowns men, and fire burns men. If after death, a man's spirit becomes a thing of the Five Elements, it can harm men; if it does not, it cannot harm men. If it is not a physical thing, then it is merely qi."

Therefore, if a person's spirit transformed into an "object of the Five Elements" after death, it could harm people. If it did not, it could not cause harm. As long as one could resist objects of the Five Elements, one could resist the attacks of malicious ghosts.

This was all knowledge Li Qi had obtained last night by leafing through the book and asking Shen Shuibi.

Based on this knowledge, Li Qi could determine that the ghost he was currently facing could not only harm people but even lay curses. This showed that it must have retained a portion of its power. In other words, its corpse was still intact and hadn't completely rotted away.

In that case, he needed to use the method for offering sacrifices to a 'dead person' to conduct the rite.

This was because, to an Invocator, a 'dead person' and a 'ghost' were two entirely different concepts.

Li Qi muttered to himself, "The calendar of sacrifices also has auspicious and inauspicious days. If it happens to be the fierce days of Blood Taboo or Moon Kill, slaughtering animals to set up a sacrifice will inevitably bring disaster. To sacrifice is to offer food to a ghost; a ghost is the essence of a dead man. As we provide for the living, so we provide for the dead. As we treat the living, so we treat the ghost. Seeing that living men require food and drink, the dead who become ghosts must also be able to eat and drink. Feeling the objects and longing for one's kin is the reason for sacrifice. As for the shrines of other gods and the hundred ghosts, although they are not the dead, the rites for serving them are the same as those for the dead—"

This was the record of the method for sacrificing to the dead within the [Book of Invocation].

To explain it simply, it meant extrapolating the practices of providing for the living to making offerings to the dead. One treated the dead with the same etiquette used for the living.

However, the first sentence clearly noted that one needed to pay attention to special periods like Blood Taboo and Moon Kill. Sacrifices could not be held during these times, or else disasters would be invited.

Having used his knowledge to determine the timing of the sacrifice, he confirmed that today posed no problems.

_Then, let it begin._

According to the records in the [Book of Invocation], the etiquette to be used at this moment was the Rite of Offering Food, which meant the etiquette of presenting cooked food.

The ceremonial process was extremely complex. First, the Invocator entered, and then proceeded to offer two stem-bowls. One stem-bowl held pickled mallow, and the other held snail paste. The stem-bowl containing the snail paste was placed to the north.

Using a dagger, the body of the sacrificial animal was lifted from its container and placed upon a sacrificial stand. The assistant set up the stand to honor the "corpse," positioning the organ-meat stand to the west of the eastern steps, covering it with a cloth veil.

Li Qi had already had the Wang family prepare these items the day before.

Next, the fish was brought in and arranged to the east of the pork. The mutton was specifically placed to the north of the pork and fish.

Two bowls containing broomcorn and foxtail millet were set to the south of the sacrificial stands, with the western side considered the position of honor.

Two tureens holding meat broth and vegetable broth were placed to the south of the stem-bowls, arrayed facing southwards from the stem-bowls.

At this time, the Invocator had to wash the wine goblets and horn cups. After pouring the wine, they were arranged to the south of the tureens. Following this, the lid of the grain vessel was opened and placed facing upward to the south of the bowls.

Then, the Invocator stood up, positioned himself to the right of the altar, and began his recitation.

"Spirit of the lower earth, Li Qi respectfully bows and welcomes you in the outskirts. This ignorant child has caused a disturbance, yet seeks peace."

"Today, I have fully prepared the sacrificial rites to summon and appease you... I earnestly beg your forgiveness. Come and partake of this food. If you possess a spirit, can you reveal it to me?"

This was a plea for forgiveness.

Li Qi grew tense.

Because the next step was: "The Invocator welcomes the 'corpse' outside the door. The master descends and stands to the east of the eastern steps."

What did this mean?

It meant that the Invocator invited the 'corpse' to ascend the steps and enter the hall, while the master of the house descended the hall, stood to the east of the eastern steps, and waited quietly.

If the guest of honor heard it, it was time for it to arrive.
