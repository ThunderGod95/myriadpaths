# Chapter 26: Sleeping

Continuing to read, he actually discovered his own wanted poster.

It wasn't exactly a wanted poster for him, but rather regarding the incident where he killed people.

"There is a demon that killed people in Li Prefecture City and fled. According to witnesses: the demon is eight feet tall, has blood-red skin, its brute strength astonishing, and is impervious to swords and spears. It killed over a dozen people in succession within Li Prefecture City. It is extremely vicious and is suspected to have possessed a tracker named Li Qi. Its current whereabouts are unknown. This is to notify the county people to be cautious. If this demon is encountered, one must flee immediately. Those with clues will be rewarded five hundred coins. Those with evidence of killing this beast will be rewarded one thousand coins. Those who capture this scoundrel beast will be rewarded one thousand five hundred coins."

So, killing a dozen people made him worth one thousand five hundred coins, barely reaching one-tenth of a gold piece.

According to current prices, using Great Deer Wuzhu coins, it would take at least ten thousand coins to exchange for one gold.

That Lady Luofu, whose death would grant land and a title, was worth a hundred gold just for a clue.

A hundred gold... just how large a sum of money was that?

He didn't dare to imagine.

Li Qi looked composed. Although he was wanted, this was originally within his calculations, so there was nothing strange about it.

Though saying he was possessed by a demon...

Uh, that should be Sixth Uncle's idea.

He hadn't killed everyone; those Strong Force Gang trackers who escaped back would likely all know that the red-skinned strong demon was actually Li Qi.

At that time, Li Qi had also fled directly.

The magistrate would definitely go to the Wave-Rowing Gang to ask about the situation.

The Wave-Rowing Gang would definitely insist they knew nothing. Plus, for so many years, the Wave-Rowing Gang had been just like that; both their cultivation methods and conduct were very normal.

Given this situation, the only person the magistrate would suspect was Li Qi. Either he had learned some evil technique by chance, or he had been possessed by some demon, using Li Qi's face to kill people before fleeing.

The Demon Suppression Division had certainly been mobilized, but that gamble Li Qi took back then seemed to have paid off.

He was a person of the Outer Dao; divination methods would have difficulty finding his location. If divination couldn't do it, then they could only rely on clues to find him.

Unfortunately, the name Li Qi was unbelievably common. There were at least ten thousand people named Li Qi in Li Prefecture. Searching by name was basically looking for a needle in a haystack.

Then they could only rely on portraits to find him.

Who would they get to draw the portrait?

Heh, the ones most familiar with Li Qi were none other than the Wave-Rowing Gang.

He trusted Sixth Uncle very much. Sixth Uncle would definitely make the portrait unrecognizable. As long as he didn't expose the characteristic red skin of the Ox Strength Art in front of others, nothing should happen.

In the end, the world was too chaotic. If this kind of wanted criminal wasn't caught after a few months, it would just pass.

Because this couldn't even be considered a proper wanted order; it could only be called a public notification.

A real arrest warrant wasn't such a trivial thing; that required yellow paper.

Surely the magistrate also knew the hope was slim, so they didn't even open a case file!

After all, if a case was opened, they would have to give an explanation to their superiors during the year-end audit. Without a case file, it didn't matter. Would the Strong Force Gang dare to pressure the magistrate?

As long as he dragged it out past this period, changed his name and identity, and swaggered back into Li Prefecture City, no one would likely pay him any mind.

Just like those traveling merchants. Ba Kui and the others surely had human lives on their hands. These people didn't care about doing some bad deeds in passing while in the wild.

Merchants in normal times, thieves when given the chance, and they wouldn't be pursued.

This was the norm. This world was just like this. Did anyone think a world where individual strength was exaggerated to such a degree would be peaceful?

"It is precisely because of this... that I need to obtain the power to protect myself." Having almost died without a burial place on this solo journey, the desire to become stronger grew within Li Qi's heart.

It was just that...

"Sigh, let's go first. I have to find a place to sleep." Li Qi turned away from the notice board.

The lines between different groups were clearly drawn; how easy was it to join one? Whether it was a sect or a gang, they weren't places one could just join and gain trust.

Either one grew up in it from childhood, with one's roots clearly known, making trust easy to obtain.

Or... be prepared to risk one's life to exchange for trust.

If Li Qi hadn't saved the Wave-Rowing Gang time and time again, he wouldn't have received such trust either.

The Wave-Rowing Gang was small and their affairs minor, so his abilities could still be displayed a bit to gain trust. But in those large gangs and sects, what could he be? Even if he went in as a low-level member, he probably wouldn't get the core cultivation methods. It might turn out even worse than the Wave-Shattering Force.

Thinking about it this way... obtaining a spell art by chance really was explosive luck.

So... what should be the next step?

Li Qi paid one coin for the entry tax. This was a head tax. After entering the city, one would get a wooden tablet called a *Chuanyan*, which was required for staying at inns or shopping.

The *Chuanyan* system was very advanced, but Li Qi didn't know why the *Chuanyan* of the Great Deer Kingdom was calculated separately for each city and didn't keep records. If lost, it could be replaced by spending money, and it wasn't valid between different cities.

This series of measures caused the population to be very chaotic, and it was unknown why such a strange system was adopted.

Perhaps there were some hidden circumstances.

Walking into the city, Li Qi didn't plan to stay at an inn. He first took out the dry rations from his bag, planning to eat them tonight, then bought some fried rice, rice cakes, and the like to store up.

There was no helping it; rice was the cheapest.

He heard that in the north, wheat noodles were the cheapest, but in this part of the Great Deer Kingdom, there were many mountains and rivers, perilous everywhere, and little flat land. It was hard to grow wheat, so they mostly ate rice.

Farmers opened up terraced fields on the mountains. It was said that farm families had methods to let crops absorb the mountain qi, which was how they could grow spirit rice with a yield of three thousand jin per mu.

In this world... even being a farmer required a trick or two. It really was...

Thinking of this, Li Qi bought another pot of tea at a roadside tea stall. Pairing it with the complimentary rice cake, he dry-chewed his own rations. His cheeks truly ached from chewing, and his mouth was so dry he had no saliva left, so he drank some tea to soothe it.

He had a big stomach and could eat seven or eight jin in one meal. This time, he planned to eat all his stored food. He ate until the sky went dark before finishing off the food and drinking all the tea. He ate until he was stuffed and left satisfied.

This meal was entirely rice without any vegetables, but there was no helping it; it was better to save money.

The sky had already turned dark. Although there were taverns and brothels still open for business, those weren't places Li Qi could set foot in. A meal in that kind of place cost dozens of coins. He had a total of one thousand coins. The tea stall on the road, dry rations, and entry fee had cost eight coins, leaving him with only nine hundred or so coins. These were his expenses for half a year, so he still needed to be frugal.

However, Ba Kui was treating him to a meal tomorrow.

He should be able to mooch some meat then.

With thoughts spinning in his head as he walked, enjoying the happiness of a round belly, Li Qi found a large mansion with eaves that extended out quite far. He sat under the eaves, tied his bundle tight, and prepared to sleep right there for the night.
