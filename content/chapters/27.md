# Chapter 27: The Gaze

After spending a few years in this world, Li Qi had long mastered the unique skill of falling asleep anywhere.

It couldn't be helped; sometimes, when hauling boats, he had to pull from dawn until dusk. By the time it ended, he was as tired as a dead dog. He would simply lie down on the riverside gravel and sleep.

He was a boat tracker; what other choice did he have?

Staying at an inn would cost at least twenty coins a night, and that was merely for a spot in a communal bunk. A single room wouldn't go for less than forty or fifty coins, and he couldn't bear to be that extravagant.

Come to think of it, the world he came from was actually quite similar.

Many farmers would till the land for a year, haul their produce into the city, and after selling everything, they would have only two or three thousand yuan left in their pockets.

They went into the city to earn that meager amount, yet staying for just one night... never mind the grand hotels, even budget express hotels would easily require one or two hundred, or even three or four hundred yuan.

So, they would rather sit by the roadside and endure the night than bear the cost of a hotel.

Li Qi currently belonged to this category.

Fortunately, at least he had eaten his fill tonight.

Curled up in the corner of a wall, with the eaves sheltering his body, it was enough.

Li Qi closed his eyes, preparing to rest. He had been rushing along the road all through the previous day and night and was utterly exhausted. He tied his bundle to his hand and tucked it inside his clothes; no one would be able to touch it without alerting him.

He went to sleep.

However, a faint, eerie gaze pierced through the deep night sky, fixing upon Li Qi.

_His temperament is passable. He possesses more than enough wit without lacking courage, and he is steady and calm. Even when facing his own wanted poster, he acted as if nothing was wrong. In what way does this kid look like a common boat tracker? As expected, is he a person of the Outer Dao?_

Back then, on the River Viewing Platform, the 'Young Master Zhu'—who had stood on the same stage as the Governor of Li Prefecture, and to whom the Governor had bowed respectfully—was now standing in a guest room of an inn not far away, watching Li Qi through the open window.

"I drained my heart's blood to perform the Grand Rite. The divination revealed that the appearance of the Outer Dao would be of great fortune to me," he muttered to himself. "The Outer Dao is difficult to divine, yet I finally found a trace after untold hardships. But... does the Outer Dao refer to this object, or that person?"

Young Master Zhu played with the broken game console in his hand.

He had already tested it with numerous methods—earth, fire, wind, water, lightning, the netherworld, divine light, and will. He had tried to interact with the object in all these ways, finally determining that it only reacted to a faint electric current.

But it was only a reaction. The components inside were damaged and could not be fully activated.

Was it the effect of this foreign object, or the effect of this person?

Young Master Zhu pondered.

"Woo... Mmph mmph mmph!" At that moment, a woman's voice came from the side. It was the muffled whimpering of someone who had been gagged.

"Stop screaming. Your cultivation base has already dissipated; you cannot break this silencing curse." Young Master Zhu put away the game console, turned around, sat on a stool, and looked at the beautiful woman on the bed.

If Li Qi were here, he would have recognized at a glance that this was Shen Shuibi, the demon he had tried everything to escape from.

"Lady Luofu's personal handmaiden... Heh, truly a big fish. The result of the Grand Rite was indeed not wrong in the slightest. The appearance of the Outer Dao is greatly auspicious for me. This kind of heaven-sent merit was actually delivered right to my mouth; I only need to open wide and bite down to take it," Young Master Zhu said to Shen Shuibi.

Shen Shuibi looked terrified. Although there appeared to be no bindings on her body, she seemed firmly restrained. She was like a fish scooped onto the shore, constantly flopping, yet she could not stand up nor get off the bed no matter how hard she tried.

Watching her struggle, Young Master Zhu seemed to find it somewhat boring. "I will undo your bindings and let you speak, but you had best cooperate properly. Can you do that?"

"If you can't, don't blame me for taking you back to Shaman God Mountain."

"Although my ability is insufficient to divine Lady Luofu's location through you, among the many Grand Diviners of Shaman God Mountain, there is always one who can. When that time comes, you won't even have the chance to cooperate with me."

"You are Lady Luofu's personal servant girl, and your karmic connection to her is extraordinary. Guess whether the Grand Diviners of Shaman God Mountain can directly trace Lady Luofu's location through you?"

"At that time, she will die because of you."

After speaking, Young Master Zhu waited for Shen Shuibi's answer.

He saw Shen Shuibi stop thrashing about, though tears welled up in her eyes, falling *pitter-patter* downwards.

She sobbed for a while, then hurriedly wiped her tears on the pillow and nodded.

It looked like she had agreed to cooperate.

Seeing this, Young Master Zhu waved his hand casually, undoing the bindings on her body.

Suddenly gaining her freedom, she did not move.

"This Grand Invocator..." Shen Shuibi looked at Young Master Zhu, trembling.

"Not so. I am merely an Invocator, not a Grand Invocator. But it doesn't matter; address me however you like," Young Master Zhu said.

He maintained the appearance of a young scholar, looking very amiable.

"Shen Shuibi, is it? You don't need to be so afraid. I bound you before simply because I feared you might have some secret technique. Now that you have confirmed you will cooperate, and since you don't have any such techniques, why would I make things difficult for you?"

"Furthermore, you should have sensed it too, right? If I really wanted to take you back to Shaman God Mountain, I would have left long ago. Why would I stay until now?" Young Master Zhu reasoned.

After all, she was a handmaiden by Lady Luofu's side; she should be able to comprehend his goodwill.

However, Young Master Zhu did not expect Shen Shuibi to freeze for a moment. Only then did she nod in sudden realization, her trembling body relaxing.

*Huh? This... Lady Luofu's handmaiden... is she a bit stupid?*

However, it was fine as long as she calmed down. Since she wasn't the one in charge anyway, it didn't matter whether she was stupid or not.

Seeing Shen Shuibi still in a daze, Young Master Zhu spoke again. "Shen Shuibi, do you assume that the lands of Baiyue are already the domain of the Human Dao?"

Shen Shuibi was suddenly roused and hurriedly nodded. "My Lady said... the various kingdoms of Baiyue are too deeply influenced by the Tang Empire. They no longer revere the Shaman Dao and only worship the Human Dao."

These words were so blunt that Young Master Zhu's face darkened by three shades.

"Ahem. Although Lady Luofu has knowledge, she is not a person of Baiyue, after all, and her understanding of the current situation is insufficient. Shaman God Mountain, when all is said and done, is still the master of this Baiyue. The Hundred Thousand Mountains and the various Baiyue kingdoms still listen to the commands of Shaman God Mountain!" Young Master Zhu said with a gloomy expression.

"Then why are there county seats and prefectural cities nearby? And county magistrates and officials? And they rely on laws to govern the world? I heard these are all characteristics of the Human Dao, are they not?" Shen Shuibi asked in confusion.

"Don't ask those useless questions!" Young Master Zhu was flustered and exasperated. "Let's talk business. Shaman God Mountain does not eat idle rice; we still have a say in the lands of Baiyue. Lady Luofu was wronged in the Tang Empire and fled to Baiyue. Perhaps she can come to Shaman God Mountain for an audience with the various Shaman Gods."

"But... My Lady isn't here either. What use is there in talking to me..." Shen Shuibi looked somewhat aggrieved.

"Therefore, I intend to have you take a messenger and go notify Lady Luofu." Young Master Zhu let out a long breath to restore his calm, then continued speaking.
