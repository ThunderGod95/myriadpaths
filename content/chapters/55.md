# Chapter 55: Muddled

The soldier's footsteps halted.

The eyes of the man before him... were terrifying.

Most ordinary people would feel fear and regret in the face of death.

But very few would look so fiercely vicious.

He felt as though he were looking at a cornered, dying beast—one that, despite being bathed in its own blood, would insist on taking one last bite out of its enemy before drawing its final breath.

As expected... this kind of person was the most dangerous.

The Squad Leader had not died in vain.

But—

The soldier's gaze sharpened. He would avenge his Squad Leader.

Gripping his long saber, he dragged his shattered leg, limping agonizingly toward Li Qi.

"You bastard... you bastard." He cursed incessantly, as if doing so could allow him to ignore Li Qi's gaze and the long saber brimming with baleful qi in his hands.

And Li Qi showed not the slightest hint of wavering.

Within the nocturnal mountain forest, one lay exhausted and immobile, while the other was heavily wounded from a cliff fall, barely able to suppress the agony of his injuries.

A lone moon hung high above, casting a cold, eerie gleam across the steel of their long sabers.

"Haaah—!" Finally, the soldier let out a guttural roar, incredibly pushing off with his broken leg to launch a desperate charge!

The exposed bone shards emitted an ear-piercing grinding noise. It was hard to even fathom the agonizing pain.

Yet, this sheer disregard for pain bought him the element of surprise against Li Qi.

Li Qi had never expected the enemy to charge on a shattered limb. Already exhausted beyond measure, merely leaning on his saber had required all his remaining strength. Faced with such a sudden lunge, he was completely unable to dodge.

However, Li Qi's body had been scoured by divine qi. Though caught off guard, he instantly adjusted his posture.

He didn't try to dodge. Instead, he gripped the saber with both hands, using his trembling arms to squeeze out the very last drop of strength in his body to raise the blade high.

A forward charge could not be easily halted.

The soldier gritted his teeth. His eyes wide, he forcefully twisted his body to the side to avoid a fatal blow to his own vitals, yet he still plunged his long saber straight into Li Qi's torso.

With a sickening squelch, the blade bit into flesh.

It pierced cleanly through Li Qi.

But in that exact same moment, Li Qi's blade skewered his opponent.

Even through the heavy armor.

The officer's saber was incomparably sharp, easily puncturing the armor.

After driving their blades into each other's bodies, both men simultaneously let go of their weapons.

Though Li Qi's blade was sharp, he lacked the strength to twist it and cause further damage.

While the soldier still possessed some strength, his blade wasn't sharp enough; it became wedged tightly against Li Qi's ribs, making it impossible to twist or withdraw quickly.

Thus, both men let go, abandoning their blades at the exact same moment.

Then, they embraced each other.

They hadn't forgiven one another. Rather, they resorted to tearing and biting, employing their only remaining, most primal weapons—their teeth and jaws—in a desperate, barbaric attempt to inflict even a negligible sliver of damage upon the other.

Li Qi savagely bit off his opponent's ear, while the soldier tore at Li Qi's neck until it was slick with blood.

But at that very moment, Li Qi's vision suddenly blurred.

With a loud, sickening crunch, the soldier was sent flying.

His face became a mangled mess of blood and flesh: several teeth were knocked out, his nasal bridge was shattered, and his entire visage was caved in. He was instantly devoid of breath.

By the looks of it... he had been kicked square in the face by a massive horse hoof.

Li Qi was already thoroughly depleted. Having just been impaled, the sudden relaxation caused his vision to go entirely black as he unavoidably lost consciousness.

Only vaguely did he spot the silhouette of a horse and a woman rushing toward him.

"Shen..." He barely managed a single syllable before passing out.

Earlier, he had merely been holding on by a single, stubborn breath. The moment he relaxed, he slumped over and fainted dead away.

By the time Li Qi woke up, an unknown amount of time had already passed.

He only knew that his consciousness had seemingly returned.

But it was incredibly hazy, as if he were suspended in a half-sleep.

Everything before his eyes was a smear of blurry shapes, and he couldn't feel his physical body at all.

Well, he could feel just a tiny bit.

He sensed that someone had been constantly pacing back and forth beside him, yet he couldn't make out their figure.

He couldn't focus his consciousness, rendering him completely incapable of perceiving the flow of time. He didn't know if a single second had passed, or an entire hour.

A power from the unseen world was actively dragging him downward.

It felt as though chains had bound his divine soul, attempting to haul him down into a bottomless abyss.

He seemed to feel karmic fire burning beneath him; if he plunged into it, he would be doomed to eternal damnation.

However, something was holding him back.

The chains pulling from below appeared to be formed of qi.

Yet, as this qi approached him, it seemed to weaken and dissipate.

He could only barely distinguish this much; no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't sense anything with true clarity.

The world before him felt as though it were obscured behind thick frosted glass. No matter how hard he tried to widen his eyes, he couldn't see through it.

An unknown amount of time passed like this.

Li Qi struggled, exhausting all his strength to shatter this frosted glass.

_What should I do?_ He pondered with his sole remaining sliver of consciousness.

Thinking was his instinct.

"Qi..." he murmured; this was the only viable method in his memories.

What qi could he utilize?

There wasn't a single shred of qi left within his body.

Both the Azure Dragon divine qi and the inner door god divine qi had been thoroughly depleted.

These forms of divine qi all required sacrifices to obtain.

Then, was there any qi that could be generated *without* sacrifices...?

Was there...?

Was there really any?

Li Qi pushed his muddled mind, racking his brain with all his might.

Even though a barrier seemed to be protecting him—stopping those chains from dragging him down—he had a lingering, dreadful feeling that this protection would inevitably vanish. He wouldn't be able to hold on forever.

Qi...

Qi...

_Wait... what do I rely on to cultivate the Wave-Shattering Force?_

The Wave-Shattering Force was the very first cultivation method Li Qi had practiced upon arriving in this world.

Previously, Li Qi had never deeply considered its underlying mechanics.

But now, trapped within this frosted glass box amidst his muddled state, the thought suddenly struck him.

According to the logic of this world, the Wave-Shattering Force... should also possess a corresponding qi.

Yet, it seemed... he had never actively sensed it before.

This seemed to be the only area where he might potentially interact with 'qi.'

At this thought, even while suspended in half-sleep, Li Qi decisively attempted it.

He had a premonition that if he didn't resolve this state soon—

He would likely die.

The Wave-Shattering Force... its cultivation required holding one's breath and then meticulously guiding the internal muscles.

_Wait, guiding the muscles to do what?_

_Within the muscles... Shen Shuibi mentioned there is nutritive qi, defensive qi..._

_Hold on, when the Wave-Shattering Force circulates, the flow of nutritive qi, defensive qi, and blood qi seems slightly different from their normal paths._

Utilizing his very last ounce of lucidity in this unseen world, Li Qi controlled his body, attempting to use the method of the Wave-Shattering Force to gather a sliver of qi.

Then, he felt it.

His Pre-Heaven Three Treasures—Essence, Qi, and Spirit—seemed to surge forth.

They were swept up and carried outward by his nutritive and defensive qi.

Bolstered by this power, the layer of frosted glass obscuring his vision gradually developed hairline fissures.

Li Qi's mind also seemed to steadily clear up a fraction.

It was this tiny fraction of clarity that allowed him to seize the opportunity. Grasping that minuscule trace of gathered power from the Wave-Shattering Force, he viciously stabbed it inward toward his own consciousness, desperate to shock himself fully awake!

*Crash!* It sounded as though a thunderclap had exploded right beside his ears. Li Qi's eyes snapped open, and he drew in a deep, sharp gasp of air.

Only then did he realize he was completely drenched in sweat!

And pressing down atop him was Shen Shuibi.

Her body heat was nice and warm. It was highly likely that because of her, he hadn't succumbed to hypothermia from the lingering cold qi.

There was just one other slight issue.

Namely, she was a bit *too* soft.
