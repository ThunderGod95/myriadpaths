# Chapter 11: Morale

With a bang, Lu Shan and Li Qi collided.

Li Qi immediately felt a burst of soreness in his shoulder. Unlike the crushing defeat he had expected to inflict, his opponent hadn't moved a single inch!

His sense of touch had already been dulled, yet this collision left him feeling limp and weak.

Most terrifying of all, Li Qi could see that the duration progress bar for his Ox Strength Art had suddenly accelerated from 8% to 25%!

From just this single impact, the duration of the Ox Strength Art had been shortened by nearly twenty percent!

Li Qi was shocked. Was Lu Shan really this strong?

If he were truly this powerful, the Wave-Rowing Gang would have been exterminated long ago. How could they have lasted until now?

However, he immediately noticed something.

There were two progress bars on Lu Shan’s body as well.

<div class="rustic-frame">

Formation Enhancement: 84%.

</div>

<div class="rustic-frame">

Charging: 56%.

</div>

The 'Charging' bar was increasing at a rapid pace and was about to fill up.

Disregarding the soreness in his body, Li Qi forced himself to muster another breath and slammed a headbutt into Lu Shan.

Lu Shan seemed not to have anticipated that Li Qi would recover his mobility so quickly. Forced to change his stance, he was driven back by Li Qi's headbutt.

Li Qi breathed a sigh of relief when he saw the opponent’s 'Charging' bar get interrupted.

However, the next bar, 'Attack: 100%,' filled up instantly. He had absolutely no time to react!

Lu Shan threw a punch that smashed directly into Li Qi’s nose.

Li Qi had thick skin and rough flesh right now, so he didn't feel pain.

No pain, but there was blood.

As the nosebleed started, the trackers revealed looks of pleasant surprise and let out cheers. The terror in their hearts lessened significantly.

Immediately after this happened, Li Qi saw 'Formation Enhancement: 84%' change to 78%.

It actually regressed!

_How is that possible?_

Li Qi immediately realized—it was morale!

Whether it was forming the array, charging together, the various situations just now, or even the march tonight, everything revealed a faint style of military discipline.

Sixth Uncle and the others couldn't recognize the military style, but he had watched several military parades. He understood that aura of strict obedience and could clearly distinguish the difference between a disorderly rabble and a military formation.

Although he didn't know where Lu Shan had learned this formation, it was likely inextricably linked to the military.

Since it was related to morale...

Li Qi ignored his nosebleed and decisively executed a tuck and roll, escaping Lu Shan's attack range. He then grabbed a Strong Force Gang tracker from within the military formation.

He threw a violent punch, smashing the man's head directly into his chest cavity! It made a *thud* sound, crisp to the extreme.

One look, and Lu Shan immediately understood what Li Qi intended to do.

"You dare!" he cursed loudly, rushing forward in an attempt to stop Li Qi.

At the same time, Lu Shan was endlessly shocked. How was this fellow's vision so keen? Why could he spot the formation's weakness at a glance?! He was just a tracker; where did he get such insight?

But relying on his thick hide, Li Qi took a punch from the opponent. Although there was some pain and bruising, he deliberately feigned complete indifference, grabbed another tracker, and tore his head right off.

With the bloody spine and the tracker's scream—which had not yet dissipated in the darkness—an atmosphere of terror overflowed and scattered in all directions.

"Keh keh keh!" Li Qi widened his eyes and let out a strange sound. He took a bite, filling his mouth with fresh blood that dripped onto his clothes, appearing exceptionally horrifying!

Coupled with the white pillars of air spraying from his nostrils as he breathed, his reddened skin, and that bizarre laughter, he looked exactly like a demon.

In any case, he didn't look the least bit human.

The progress bar on Lu Shan's body jumped straight to 97%.

Clearly, he also sensed that the formation was about to end, so he panicked.

"Bastard! Die for me!" He picked up a stone from the ground, using it as a weapon as he ran toward Li Qi, trying to salvage morale.

However, Li Qi did not dodge as he had before. Instead, he went straight to meet him.

Li Qi neither flashed aside nor evaded, allowing himself to be smashed by the stone. This was Lu Shan's full-power strike, carrying a massive force of full one thousand kilograms. Even with the thick hide of the Ox Strength Art, Li Qi was smashed until his head broke and blood flowed. He saw stars and nearly lost consciousness.

As for the stone, it shattered into fragments that pierced into his skin.

It could be said that this blow caused heavy injury.

However, he forcibly held on. Deliberately letting out a roar, he accepted the blow just to forcefully clamp his teeth onto Lu Shan's nose and tear it off savagely!

Half of Lu Shan's nose was bitten off directly by him!

"Argh!" Even the famously tough Big Strong Shan couldn't help but howl in pain.

The other trackers were so frightened by this scene that their courage shattered. The morale that had been rallied earlier did not survive in the slightest. Some even began to flee in panic, choosing their path blindly.

"Come back! Running now is seeking death!" He endured the pain and shouted at the trackers.

But with this shout, Li Qi seized the opportunity and smashed a fist onto his head.

Lu Shan reacted very quickly, forcibly tilting his head so the punch only landed on his shoulder, causing him to stagger and his posture to dip.

However, this blow caused the formation to collapse completely.

Li Qi watched the opponent's buff status bar hit 100% and then end directly.

All the trackers felt as if the thread binding them had been snapped.

Now, they completely lost their courage and fled in all directions, crawling and rolling, scattering like birds and beasts.

The formation buff on Lu Shan's body also dissipated instantly.

He could barely contend with the Ox Strength Art originally, but once the formation scattered, his strength returned to normal levels. He couldn't even break Li Qi's defense.

However, he did not sit and wait for death.

Picking up a stick, he roared in anger. Even without the military formation, he initiated a death match against Li Qi.

This kind of fighting spirit was not something a tracker should have.

Li Qi was not afraid. Now that the opponent's buff had ended, he was definitely no match for Li Qi.

However, after formally engaging, Li Qi’s eyes went wide as he was thrown directly to the ground!

Lu Shan's offensive was swift and fierce. It looked like he had undergone proper training. Although his physical constitution was inferior to Li Qi's, his moves were wide, sweeping, fierce, and lethal!

Although Li Qi had great strength and thick skin, he didn't understand martial arts and actually couldn't take him down for a moment.

He tried his best to parry the attacks, but he couldn't sustain the effort and was hit repeatedly.

It was only by relying on his thick skin that Lu Shan couldn't damage him.

Martial arts, in the end, could not compare to spell arts.

However, the instant Lu Shan blocked Li Qi's offense once more, Li Qi suddenly changed his move mid-way. With the aid of his massive strength, the caught-off-guard Lu Shan was smashed into the ground with a back throw!

Li Qi followed up with a knife-hand strike intended for his neck. If this hit could make Lu Shan lose consciousness, this farce would be over.

But Lu Shan performed a kip-up, flipping to his feet immediately. Just like before, he dodged the blow.

Only, Lu Shan was somewhat shocked!

Li Qi had been so clumsy just a moment ago; why did he suddenly start using technique?

He certainly didn't know why.

Only Li Qi knew.

He had started learning to observe the progress bars on his opponent during the swift combat!

As long as he could counterattack when the progress bar was in the middle, he could preempt the enemy.

In other words, it was called interrupting the cast!
