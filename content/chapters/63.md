# Chapter 63: The Wealthy Merchant

Soon enough, the morning passed. By noon, with the sun hanging high in the sky, Li Qi had sold off almost all of his pelts at his desired prices.

However, while the pelts sold well and the meat found easy buyers, some of the bones remained.

After all, there weren't many uses for beast bones, yet they were not cheap. They could only be obtained by risking one's life hunting in the wild, so the prices could not be set too low, making them less marketable.

He waited the entire morning until the meat, pelts, and even the mountain goods were sold out, but he still had bones left over.

"One hundred and twenty-five... one hundred and twenty-six... Ah, we already have six thousand, one hundred and twenty-six coins. Forget it, if these won't sell, then so be it. Let's pack them up and go buy some clothes first," Li Qi said to Shen Shuibi as he counted the strings of cash on his person.

One string was a thousand copper coins, plus one hundred and twenty-six loose coins, making seven bundles in total. He counted them clearly one by one, tied them tightly with rope, and then strapped them to his body, hanging them over his arm.

They were completely impossible to steal, kept right in front of his eyes.

Given Li Qi's current arm strength, having over six thousand coins wrapped around one arm would no longer severely impact his mobility.

Shen Shuibi hurriedly nodded. In this bustling place full of people coming and going, where social interaction was unavoidable, the peace-loving rabbit who had lived on an immortal mountain since childhood felt extremely uncomfortable. Hearing that they were about to leave, she quickly helped Li Qi pack up the stall.

But right at that moment, someone suddenly stepped forward and struck up a conversation. "Eh, little brother, are you the one selling these goat bones, fox bones, and tortoise shells?"

Shen Shuibi immediately withdrew her hands and resumed squatting and playing dead.

Li Qi, however, flashed a bright, toothy grin and leaned in, saying with a radiant smile, "That's right, I'm selling them. Are you looking to buy, big brother? It just so happens I'm about to close shop. How about you take all of these for a total of one thousand coins? That's a real bargain."

While saying this, Li Qi nonchalantly appraised the man.

"Look at these bones—gleaming white and completely pristine. Whether you use them as divination bones or carve them into bone slips, they're top-quality goods. And this goat skull here is as hard as iron; the horns attached can be used in medicine. Ground into bone powder, they can invigorate the blood, stimulate qi, and dispel wind and cold." Li Qi instantly switched into salesman mode, smoothly pitching his wares to the sudden customer.

"The goods are fine, and they look like fresh kills from the past few days. A thousand coins is a fair price; I'll take them," the man said with straightforward decisiveness.

As he spoke, Li Qi finished his appraisal.

He seemed to be a wealthy merchant. His clothes were made of cotton and embroidered with intricate patterns. He had a plump, highly amiable appearance, and the neat little mustache on his lip was impeccably groomed.

How should he put it...

He looked a bit like the God of Wealth.

The exact kind you would see plastered on doors during the Spring Festival.

"Alrighty, I'll bag them up for you right now!" Even though the man had a comical appearance, anyone willing to spend a thousand coins was a genuine God of Wealth. Li Qi immediately bent down to pack up his beast bones.

These beast bones came in many varieties, each with different uses. He had no idea what the man wanted all of them for, but he guessed it definitely wasn't for anything normal.

But that didn't matter. Li Qi couldn't care less. All he wanted was to offload them quickly, buy a new outfit and some travel necessities, and get back on the road.

"No, no, no, even if you bag them up, I won't be able to carry them. Look at me, I'm quite frail." The wealthy man waved his hand. "Since I'm buying them all, how about you do me a favor and deliver them for free? It's not far, just in the western part of the city. I'll pay you once we get there."

"You got it! Please lead the way, Boss!" Li Qi agreed without hesitation. It just so happened that there were tailor shops selling clothes in the west of the city, so it was along the way.

The wealthy man smiled and led the way, having Li Qi carry the basket of beast bones on his back as they headed toward the west end of the city.

Seeing this, Shen Shuibi also stood up and trailed behind Li Qi.

"And who might this little miss be?" the wealthy man asked, looking at Shen Shuibi with some curiosity.

"This is my younger sister. I brought her into the city to broaden her horizons," Li Qi replied, discreetly shielding Shen Shuibi from view.

"Your younger sister? Well, isn't that a rarity; you two don't look alike at all~." Upon hearing this, the wealthy man was amused and chuckled aloud.

"You're dark and swarthy, with calluses on your shoulders. It's obvious you do manual labor—a boat tracker or a porter. But look at your little sister—she's as fair as a porcelain doll, the very picture of a young lady from a great family. How could she be your sister?" he asked.

"Boss, I used to be pale too, but with the wind and the sun, even the whitest skin turns dark." Li Qi scratched his head, putting on an act. "But my little sister is different. I couldn't bear to let her go out and do hard labor."

"That's true. I have a younger sister at home as well. She isn't as pretty as yours, but as fathers and elder brothers, we'd rather endure more hardship than see our sisters toil away." The wealthy man spoke, seemingly deeply moved by the sentiment.

Naturally, Shen Shuibi kept her head bowed and followed silently.

Although she was trailing behind, she acted as if she hadn't heard a word, keeping her eyes fixed on her nose and her nose aligned with her heart in a meditative state.

This was per Li Qi's instructions. As she was naturally poor at socializing, she was more than happy to oblige, sparing herself the effort.

The trio walked all the way to the western part of the city.

In the west of the city stood a sprawling mansion.

It looked like a highly luxurious estate, perfectly befitting a wealthy man's status and financial power.

However, what struck Li Qi as odd was the absence of servants and house guards. Even the stone lions at the entrance were covered in moss, making it look as though the place hadn't been maintained in a very long time.

Yet, contradicting that, cooking smoke rose from within, and the place possessed human qi.

Li Qi made a mental note to stay vigilant, as he had noticed that the wealthy man had ventured out by himself without any attendants.

"My family has a rule against employing servants. But since the mansion is so large, it's difficult to keep tidy. Please excuse the mess," the wealthy man said with a smile, pushing open the doors.

A gust of cold, eerie wind swept out, making Li Qi shiver.

When the gate opened, a draft blew straight through the hall, and he saw a blind old woman sitting in the courtyard.

"Mother, why are you sitting out here again? It's cold; you should go inside and warm yourself by the fire!" The wealthy man hurriedly rushed in and supported the blind old woman, his tone fraught with worry.

However, he immediately turned around and pulled a piece of fragmented gold from his pocket. "This is about one-tenth of a tael of gold, roughly a thousand coins. Take it. You can leave the beast bones over there and be on your way."

From beginning to end, the blind old woman showed zero reaction and uttered not a single word.

Li Qi nodded, accepting the gold. He weighed it in his hand; it felt about right.

A full tael of gold was worth ten thousand coins, so one-tenth was roughly a thousand coins.

Even though Li Qi felt the mansion was oozing with Yin qi and was definitely abnormal, he was in no mood to dig deeper into the matter. He had received his payment and delivered the goods, so it was time to leave.

Thus, after verifying the gold, he put down the beast bones, strapped his empty wicker basket onto his back, and left with Shen Shuibi.

Except, as soon as they walked out the door, Shen Shuibi whispered quietly, "That woman just now... she seemed to be a Diviner."
